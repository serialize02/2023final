People lining up outside classrooms stood on tiptoe to get a look at him, or doubled back to pass him in the corridors again, staring. Harry wished they wouldn't, because he was trying to concentrate on finding his way to classes.  There were a hundred and forty-two staircases at Hogwarts: wide, sweeping ones; narrow, rickety ones; some that led somewhere different on a Friday; some with a vanishing step halfway up that you had to remember to jump. Then there were doors that wouldn't open unless you asked politely, or tickled them in exactly the right place, and doors that weren't really doors at all, but solid walls just pretending. It was also very hard to remember where anything was, because it all seemed to move around a lot. The people in the portraits kept going to visit each other, and Harry was sure the coats of armor could walk.  The ghosts didn't help, either. It was always a nasty shock when one of them glided suddenly through a door you were trying to open. Nearly Headless Nick was always happy to point new Gryffindors in the right direction, but Peeves the Poltergeist was worth two locked doors and a trick staircase if you met him when you were late for class. He would drop wastepaper baskets on your head, pull rugs from under your feet, pelt you with bits of chalk, or sneak up behind you, invisible, grab your nose, and screech, \\\\\\\"GOT YOUR CONK!\\\\\\\"  Even worse than Peeves, if that was possible, was the caretaker, Argus Filch. Harry and Ron managed to get on the wrong side of him on their very first morning. Filch found them trying to force their way through a door that unluckily turned out to be the entrance to the out-of-bounds corridor on the third floor. He wouldn't believe they were lost, was sure they were trying to break into it on purpose, and was threatening to lock them in the dungeons when they were rescued by Professor Quirrell, who was passing.  Filch owned a cat called Mrs. Norris, a scrawny, dust-colored creature with bulging, lamp like eyes just like Filch's. She patrolled the corridors alone. Break a rule in front of her, put just one toe out of line, and she'd whisk off for Filch, who'd appear, wheezing, two seconds later. Filch knew the secret passageways of the school better than anyone (except perhaps the Weasley twins) and could pop up as suddenly as any of the ghosts. The students all hated him, and it was the dearest ambition of many to give Mrs. Norris a good kick.  And then, once you had managed to find them, there were the classes themselves. There was a lot more to magic, as Harry quickly found out, than waving your wand and saying a few funny words.  They had to study the night skies through their telescopes every Wednesday at midnight and learn the names of different stars and the movements of the planets. Three times a week they went out to the greenhouses behind the castle to study Herbology, with a dumpy little witch called Professor Sprout, where they learned how to take care of all the strange plants and fungi, and found out what they were used for.  Easily the most boring class was History of Magic, which was the only one taught by a ghost. Professor Binns had been very old  indeed when he had fallen asleep in front of the staff room fire and got up next morning to teach, leaving his body behind him. Binns droned on and on while they scribbled down names and dates, and got Emetic the Evil and Uric the Oddball mixed up.  Professor Flitwick, the Charms teacher, was a tiny little wizard who had to stand on a pile of books to see over his desk. At the start of their first class he took the roll call, and when he reached Harry's name he gave an excited squeak and toppled out of sight.  Professor McGonagall was again different. Harry had been quite right to think she wasn't a teacher to cross. Strict and clever, she gave them a talking-to the moment they sat down in her first class.  \\\\\\\"Transfiguration is some of the most complex and dangerous magic you will learn at Hogwarts,\\\\\\\" she said. \\\\\\\"Anyone messing around in my class will leave and not come back. You have been warned.\\\\\\\"  Then she changed her desk into a pig and back again. They were all very impressed and couldn't wait to get started, but soon realized they weren't going to be changing the furniture into animals for a long time. After taking a lot of complicated notes, they were each given a match and started trying to turn it into a needle. By the end of the lesson, only Hermione Granger had made any difference to her match; Professor McGonagall showed the class how it had gone all silver and pointy and gave Hermione a rare smile.  The class everyone had really been looking forward to was Defense Against the Dark Arts, but Quirrell's lessons turned out to be a bit of a joke. His classroom smelled strongly of garlic, which everyone said was to ward off a vampire he'd met in Romania and was afraid would be coming back to get him one of these days. His turban, he told them, had been given to him by an African prince as a thank-you for getting rid of a troublesome zombie, but they weren't sure they believed this story. For one thing, when Seamus Finnigan asked eagerly to hear how Quirrell had fought off the zombie, Quirrell went pink and started talking about the weather; for another, they had noticed that a funny smell hung around the turban, and the Weasley twins insisted that it was stuffed full of garlic as well, so that Quirrell was protected wherever he went.  Harry was very relieved to find out that he wasn't miles behind everyone else. Lots of people had come from Muggle families and, like him, hadn't had any idea that they were witches and wizards. There was so much to learn that even people like Ron didn't have much of a head start.  Friday was an important day for Harry and Ron. They finally managed to find their way down to the Great Hall for breakfast without getting lost once.  \\\\\\\"What have we got today?\\\\\\\" Harry asked Ron as he poured sugar on his porridge.  \\\\\\\"Double Potions with the Slytherins,\\\\\\\" said Ron. \\\\\\\"Snape's Head of Slytherin House. They say he always favors them -- we'll be able to see if it's true.\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"Wish McGonagall favored us, \\\\\\\" said Harry. Professor McGonagall was head of Gryffindor House, but it hadn't stopped her from giving them a huge pile of homework the day before.  Just then, the mail arrived. Harry had gotten used to this by now, but it had given him a bit of a shock on the first morning, when about a hundred owls had suddenly streamed into the Great Hall during breakfast, circling the tables until they saw their owners, and dropping letters and packages onto their laps.  Hedwig hadn't brought Harry anything so far. She sometimes flew in to nibble his ear and have a bit of toast before going off to sleep in the owlery with the other school owls. This morning, however, she fluttered down between the marmalade and the sugar bowl and dropped a note onto Harry's plate. Harry tore it open at once. It said, in a very untidy scrawl:  Dear Harry,  I know you get Friday afternoons off, so would you like to come and have a cup of tea with me around three?  I want to hear all about your first week. Send us an answer back with Hedwig.  Hagrid  Harry borrowed Ron's quill, scribbled Yes, please, see you later on the back of the note, and sent Hedwig off again.  It was lucky that Harry had tea with Hagrid to look forward to, because the Potions lesson turned out to be the worst thing that had happened to him so far.  At the start-of-term banquet, Harry had gotten the idea that Professor Snape disliked him. By the end of the first Potions lesson, he knew he'd been wrong. Snape didn't dislike Harry -- he hated him.  Potions lessons took place down in one of the dungeons. It was colder here than up in the main castle, and would have been quite creepy enough without the pickled animals floating in glass jars all around the walls.  Snape, like Flitwick, started the class by taking the roll call, and like Flitwick, he paused at Harry's name.  \\\\\\\"Ah, Yes,\\\\\\\" he said softly, \\\\\\\"Harry Potter. Our new -- celebrity.\\\\\\\"  Draco Malfoy and his friends Crabbe and Goyle sniggered behind their hands. Snape finished calling the names and looked up at the class. His eyes were black like Hagrid's, but they had none of Hagrid's warmth. They were cold and empty and made you think of dark tunnels.  \\\\\\\"You are here to learn the subtle science and exact art of potionmaking,\\\\\\\" he began. He spoke in barely more than a whisper, but they caught every word -- like Professor McGonagall, Snape had y caught every word -- like Professor McGonagall, Snape had the gift of keeping a class silent without effort. \\\\\\\"As there is little foolish wand-waving here, many of you will hardly believe this is magic. I don't expect you will really understand the beauty of the softly simmering cauldron with its shimmering fumes, the delicate power of liquids that creep through human veins, bewitching the mind, ensnaring the senses.... I can teach you how to bottle fame, brew glory, even stopper death -- if you aren't as big a bunch of dunderheads as I usually have to teach.\\\\\\\"  More silence followed this little speech. Harry and Ron exchanged looks with raised eyebrows. Hermione Granger was on the edge of her seat and looked desperate to start proving that she wasn't a dunderhead.  \\\\\\\"Potter!\\\\\\\" said Snape suddenly. \\\\\\\"What would I get if I added powdered root of asphodel to an infusion of wormwood?\\\\\\\"  Powdered root of what to an infusion of what? Harry glanced at Ron, who looked as stumped as he was; Hermione's hand had shot into the air.  \\\\\\\"I don't know, sit,\\\\\\\" said Harry.  Snape's lips curled into a sneer.  \\\\\\\"Tut, tut -- fame clearly isn't everything.\\\\\\\"  He ignored Hermione's hand.  \\\\\\\"Let's try again. Potter, where would you look if I told you to find me a bezoar?\\\\\\\"  Hermione stretched her hand as high into the air as it would go without her leaving her seat, but Harry didn't have the faintest idea what a bezoar was. He tried not to look at Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle, who were shaking with laughter.  \\\\\\\"I don't know, sit.\\\\\\\" \\\\\\\"Thought you wouldn't open a book before coming, eh, Potter?\\\\\\\" Harry forced himself to keep looking straight into those cold eyes. He had looked through his books at the Dursleys', but did Snape expect him to remember everything in One Thousand Magical Herbs and Fungi?  Snape was still ignoring Hermione's quivering hand.  \\\\\\\"What is the difference, Potter, between monkshood and wolfsbane?\\\\\\\"  At this, Hermione stood up, her hand stretching toward the dungeon ceiling.  \\\\\\\"I don't know,\\\\\\\" said Harry quietly. \\\\\\\"I think Hermione does, though, why don't you try her?\\\\\\\"  A few people laughed; Harry caught Seamus's eye, and Seamus winked. Snape, however, was not pleased.  \\\\\\\"Sit down,\\\\\\\" he snapped at Hermione. \\\\\\\"For your information, Potter, asphodel and wormwood make a sleeping potion so powerful it is known as the Draught of Living Death. A bezoar is a stone taken from the stomach of a goat and it will save you from most poisons. As for monkshood and wolfsbane, they are the same plant, which also goes by the name of aconite. Well? Why aren't you all copying that down?\\\\\\\"  There was a sudden rummaging for quills and parchment. Over the noise, Snape said, \\\\\\\"And a point will be taken from Gryffindor House for your cheek, Potter.\\\\\\\"  Things didn't improve for the Gryffindors as the Potions lesson continued. Snape put them all into pairs and set them to mixing up a simple potion to cure boils. He swept around in his long black cloak, watching them weigh dried nettles and crush snake fangs, criticizing almost everyone except Malfoy, whom he seemed to like. He was just telling everyone to look at the perfect way Malfoy had stewed his horned slugs when clouds of acid green smoke and a loud hissing filled the dungeon. Neville had somehow managed to melt Seamus's cauldron into a twisted blob, and their potion was seeping across the stone floor, burning holes in people's shoes. Within seconds, the whole class was standing on their stools while Neville, who had been drenched in the potion when the cauldron collapsed, moaned in pain as angry red boils sprang up all over his arms and legs.  \\\\\\\"Idiot boy!\\\\\\\" snarled Snape, clearing the spilled potion away with one wave of his wand. \\\\\\\"I suppose you added the porcupine quills before taking the cauldron off the fire?\\\\\\\"  Neville whimpered as boils started to pop up all over his nose.  \\\\\\\"Take him up to the hospital wing,\\\\\\\" Snape spat at Seamus. Then he rounded on Harry and Ron, who had been working next to Neville.  \\\\\\\"You -- Potter -- why didn't you tell him not to add the quills? Thought he'd make you look good if he got it wrong, did you? That's another point you've lost for Gryffindor.\\\\\\\"  This was so unfair that Harry opened his mouth to argue, but Ron kicked him behind their cauldron.  \\\\\\\"Doi* push it,\\\\\\\" he muttered, \\\\\\\"I've heard Snape can turn very nasty.\\\\\\\"  As they climbed the steps out of the dungeon an hour later, Harry's mind was racing and his spirits were low. He'd lost two points for Gryffindor in his very first week -- why did Snape hate him so much? \\\\\\\"Cheer up,\\\\\\\" said Ron, \\\\\\\"Snape's always taking points off Fred and George. Can I come and meet Hagrid with you?\\\\\\\"  At five to three they left the castle and made their way across the grounds. Hagrid lived in a small wooden house on the edge of the forbidden forest. A crossbow and a pair of galoshes were outside the front door.  When Harry knocked they heard a frantic scrabbling from inside and several booming barks. Then Hagrid's voice rang out, saying, \\\\\\\"Back, Fang -- back.\\\\\\\"  Hagrid's big, hairy face appeared in the crack as he pulled the door open.  \\\\\\\"Hang on,\\\\\\\" he said. \\\\\\\"Back, Fang.\\\\\\\"  He let them in, struggling to keep a hold on the collar of an enormous black boarhound.  There was only one room inside. Hams and pheasants were hanging from the ceiling, a copper kettle was boiling on the open fire, and in the corner stood a massive bed with a patchwork quilt over it.  \\\\\\\"Make yerselves at home,\\\\\\\" said Hagrid, letting go of Fang, who bounded straight at Ron and started licking his ears. Like Hagrid, Fang was clearly not as fierce as he looked.  \\\\\\\"This is Ron,\\\\\\\" Harry told Hagrid, who was pouring boiling water into a large teapot and putting rock cakes onto a plate.  \\\\\\\"Another Weasley, eh?\\\\\\\" said Hagrid, glancing at Ron's freckles. I spent half me life chasin' yer twin brothers away from the forest.\\\\\\\"  The rock cakes were shapeless lumps with raisins that almost broke their teeth, but Harry and Ron pretended to be enjoying them as they told Hagrid all about their first -lessons. Fang rested his head on Harry's knee and drooled all over his robes.  Harry and Ron were delighted to hear Hagrid call Fitch \\\\\\\"that old git.\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"An' as fer that cat, Mrs. Norris, I'd like ter introduce her to Fang sometime. D'yeh know, every time I go up ter the school, she follows me everywhere? Can't get rid of her -- Fitch puts her up to it.\\\\\\\"  Harry told Hagrid about Snape's lesson. Hagrid, like Ron, told Harry not to worry about it, that Snape liked hardly any of the students.  \\\\\\\"But he seemed to really hate me.\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"Rubbish!\\\\\\\" said Hagrid. \\\\\\\"Why should he?\\\\\\\"  Yet Harry couldn't help thinking that Hagrid didn't quite meet his eyes when he said that.  \\\\\\\"How's yer brother Charlie?\\\\\\\" Hagrid asked Ron. \\\\\\\"I liked him a lot -- great with animals.\\\\\\\"  Harry wondered if Hagrid had changed the subject on purpose. While Ron told Hagrid all about Charlie's work with dragons, Harry picked up a piece of paper that was lying on the table under the tea cozy. It was a cutting from the Daily Prophet:  GRINGOTTS BREAK-IN LATEST  Investigations continue into the break-in at Gringotts on 31 July, widely believed to be the work of Dark wizards or witches unknown.  Gringotts goblins today insisted that nothing had been taken. The vault that was searched had in fact been emptied the same day.  \\\\\\\"But we're not telling you what was in there, so keep your noses out if you know what's good for you,\\\\\\\" said a Gringotts spokesgoblin this afternoon.  Harry remembered Ron telling him on the train that someone had tried to rob Gringotts, but Ron hadn't mentioned the date.  \\\\\\\"Hagrid!\\\\\\\" said Harry, \\\\\\\"that Gringotts break-in happened on my birthday! It might've been happening while we were there!\\\\\\\"  There was no doubt about it, Hagrid definitely didn't meet Harry's eyes this time. He grunted and offered him another rock cake. Harry read the story again. The vault that was searched had in fact been emptied earlier that same day. Hagrid had emptied vault seven hundred and thirteen, if you could call it emptying, taking out that grubby little package. Had that been what the thieves were looking for?  As Harry and Ron walked back to the castle for dinner, their pockets weighed down with rock cakes they'd been too polite to refuse, Harry thought that none of the lessons he'd had so far had given him as much to think about as tea with Hagrid. Had Hagrid collected that package just in time? Where was it now? And did Hagrid know something about Snape that he didn't want to tell Harry?  \\\"\",\n          \"still, heart-shaped confetti was falling from the pale blue ceiling. Harry went over to the Gryffindor table, where Ron was sitting looking sickened, and Hermione seemed to have been overcome with giggles.  \\\\What's going on?\\\\\\\" Harry asked them, sitting down and wiping confetti off his bacon.  Ron pointed to the teachers' table, apparently too disgusted to speak. Lockhart, wearing lurid pink robes to match the decorations, was waving for silence. The teachers on either side of him were looking stony-faced. From where he sat, Harry could see a muscle going in Professor McGonagall's cheek. Snape looked as though someone had just fed him a large beaker of Skele-Gro.  \\\\\\\"Happy Valentine's Day!\\\\\\\" Lockhart shouted. \\\\\\\"And may I thank the forty-six people who have so far sent me cards! Yes, I have taken the liberty of arranging this little surprise for you all - and it doesn't end here!\\\\\\\"  Lockhart clapped his hands and through the doors to the entrance hall marched a dozen surly-looking dwarfs. Not just any dwarfs, however. Lockhart had them all wearing golden wings and carrying harps.  \\\\\\\"My friendly, card-carrying cupids!\\\\\\\" beamed Lockhart. \\\\\\\"They will be roving around the school today delivering your valentines! And the fun doesn't stop here! I'm sure my colleagues will want to enter into the spirit of the occasion! Why not ask Professor Snape to show you how to whip up a Love Potion! And while you're at it, Professor Flitwick knows more about Entrancing Enchantments than any wizard I've ever met, the sly old dog!\\\\\\\"  Professor Flitwick buried his face in his hands. Snape was look  * 236  ing as though the first person to ask him for a Love Potion would be force-fed poison.  \\\\\\\"Please, Hermione, tell me you weren't one of the forty-six, 51 said Ron as they left the Great Hall for their first lesson. Hermione suddenly became very interested in searching her bag for her schedule and didn't answer.  All day long, the dwarfs kept barging into their classes to deliver valentines, to the annoyance of the teachers, and late that afternoon as the Gryffindors were walking upstairs for Charms, one of the dwarfs caught up with Harry.  \\\\\\\"Oy, you! 'Arty Potter!\\\\\\\" shouted a particularly grim-looking dwarf, elbowing people out of the way to get to Harry.  Hot all over at the thought of being given a valentine in front of a line of first years, which happened to include Ginny Weasley, Harry tried to escape. The dwarf, however, cut his way through the crowd by kicking people's shins, and reached him before he'd gone two paces.  \\\\\\\"I've got a musical message to deliver to 'Arry Potter in person,\\\\\\\" he said, twanging his harp in a threatening sort of way.  \\\\\\\"Not here,\\\\\\\" Harry hissed, trying to escape.  \\\\\\\"Stay still!\\\\\\\" grunted the dwarf, grabbing hold of Harry's bag and pulling him back.  \\\\\\\"Let me go!\\\\\\\" Harry snarled, tugging.  With a loud ripping noise, his bag split in two. His books, wand, parchment, and quill spilled onto the floor and his ink bottle smashed over everything.  Harry scrambled around, trying to pick it all up before the dwarf started singing, causing something of a holdup in the corridor.  *237*  \\\\\\\"What's going on here?\\\\\\\" came the cold, drawling voice of Draco Malfoy. Harry started stuffing everything feverishly into his ripped bag, desperate to get away before Malfoy could hear his musical valentine.  \\\\\\\"What's all this commotion?\\\\\\\" said another familiar voice as Percy Weasley arrived.  Losing his head, Harry tried to make a run for it, but the dwarf seized him around the knees and brought him crashing to the floor.  \\\\\\\"Right,\\\\\\\" he said, sitting on Harry's ankles. \\\\\\\"Here is your singing valentine:  His eyes are as green as a fresh pickled toad,  His hair is as dark as a blackboard. I wish he was mine, he's really divine, The hero who conquered the Dark Lord  Harry would have given all the gold in Gringotts to evaporate on the spot. Trying valiantly to laugh along with everyone else, he got up, his feet numb from the weight of the dwarf, as Percy Weasley did his best to disperse the crowd, some of whom were crying with mirth.  \\\\\\\"Off you go, off you go, the bell rang five minutes ago, off to class, now,\\\\\\\" he said, shooing some of the younger students away. \\\\\\\"And you, Malfoy-\\\\\\\"  Harry, glancing over, saw Malfoy stoop and snatch up something. Leering, he showed it to Crabbe and Goyle, and Harry realized that he'd got Riddle's diary.  \\\\\\\"Give that back,\\\\\\\" said Harry quietly.  \\\\\\\"Wonder what Potter's written in this?\\\\\\\" said Malfoy, who obvi  * 238  ously hadn't noticed the year on the cover and thought he had Harry's own diary. A hush fell over the onlookers. Ginny was staring from the diary to Harry, looking terrified.  \\\\\\\"Hand it over, Malfoy,\\\\\\\" said Percy sternly.  \\\\\\\"When I've had a look,\\\\\\\" said Malfoy, waving the diary tauntingly at Harry.  Percy said, \\\\\\\"As a school prefect -\\\\\\\" but Harry had lost his temper. He pulled out his wand and shouted, \\\\\\\"Expelliarmus!\\\\\\\" and just as Snape had disarmed Lockhart, so Malfoy found the diary shooting out of his hand into the air. Ron, grinning broadly, caught it.  \\\\\\\"Harry!\\\\\\\" said Percy loudly. \\\\\\\"No magic in the corridors. I'll have to report this, you know!\\\\\\\"  But Harry didn't care, he was one-up on Malfoy, and that was worth five points from Gryffindor any day. Malfoy was looking furious, and as Ginny passed him to enter her classroom, he yelled spitefully after her, \\\\\\\"I don't think Potter liked your valentine much!\\\\\\\"  Ginny covered her face with her hands and ran into class. Snarling, Ron pulled out his wand, too, but Harry pulled him away. Ron didn't need to spend the whole of Charms belching slugs.  It wasn't until they had reached Professor Flitwick's class that Harry noticed something rather odd about Riddle's diary. All his other books were drenched in scarlet ink. The diary, however, was as clean as it had been before the ink bottle had smashed all over it. He tried to point this out to Ron, but Ron was having trouble with his wand again; large purple bubbles were blossoming out of the end, and he wasn't much interested in anything else.  Harry went to bed before anyone else in his dormitory that night. This was partly because he didn't think he could stand Fred and George singing, \\\\\\\"His eyes are as green as a fresh pickled toad\\\\\\\" one more time, and partly because he wanted to examine Riddle's diary again, and knew that Ron thought he was wasting his time.  Harry sat on his four-poster and flicked through the blank pages, not one of which had a trace of scarlet ink on it. Then he pulled a new bottle out of his bedside cabinet, dipped his quill into it, and dropped a blot onto the first page of the diary.  The ink shone brightly on the paper for a second and then, as though it was being sucked into the page, vanished. Excited, Harry loaded up his quill a second time and wrote, \\\\\\\"My name is Harry Potter.\\\\\\\"  The words shone momentarily on the page and they, too, sank without trace. Then, at last, something happened.  Oozing back out of the page, in his very own ink, came words Harry had never written.  \\\\\\\"Hello, Harry Potter. My name is Tom Riddle. How did you come by my diary?\\\\\\\"  These words, too, faded away, but not before Harry had started to scribble back.  \\\\\\\"Someone tried to flush it down a toilet.\\\\\\\"  He waited eagerly for Riddle's reply.  \\\\\\\"Lucky that I recorded my memories in some more lasting way than ink. But I always knew that there would be those who would not want this diary read. \\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"What do you mean?\\\\\\\" Harry scrawled, blotting the page in his excitement.  *240*  `I mean that this diary holds memories of terrible things. Things that were covered up. Things that happened at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. \\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"That's where I am now,\\\\\\\" Harry wrote quickly. \\\\\\\"I'm at Hogwarts, and horrible stuff's been happening. Do you know anything about the Chamber of Secrets?\\\\\\\"  His heart was hammering. Riddle's reply came quickly, his writing becoming untidier, as though he was hurrying to tell all he knew.  \\\\\\\"Of course I know about the Chamber of Secrets. In my day, they told us it was a legend, that it did not exist. But this was a lie. In my fifth year, the Chamber was opened and the monster attacked several students, finally killing one. I caught the person whod opened the Chamber and he was expelled. But the Headmaster, Professor Dippet, ashamed that such a thing had happened at Hogwarts, forbade me to tell the truth. A story was given out that thegirl had died in a freak accident. They gave me a nice, shiny, engraved trophy for my trouble and warned me to keep my mouth shut. But I knew it could happen again. The monster lived on, and the one who had the power to release it was not imprisoned. \\\\\\\"  Harry nearly upset his ink bottle in his hurry to write back.  \\\\\\\"It's happening again now. There have been three attacks and no one seems to know who's behind them. Who was it last time?\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"I can show you, if you like, \\\\\\\"came Riddle's reply. \\\\\\\"You don't have  to take my word for it. I can take you inside my memory of the night when I caught him. \\\\\\\"  Harry hesitated, his quill suspended over the diary. What did Riddle mean? How could he be taken inside somebody else's memory? He glanced nervously at the door to the dormitory, which was   *241*  growing dark. When he looked back at the diary, he saw fresh words forming.  \\\\\\\"Let me show you. \\\\\\\"  Harry paused for a fraction of a second and then wrote two letters.  (40K.55  The pages of the diary began to blow as though caught in a high wind, stopping halfway through the month of June. Mouth hanging open, Harry saw that the little square for June thirteenth seemed to have turned into a miniscule television screen. His hands trembling slightly, he raised the book to press his eye against the little window, and before he knew what was happening, he was tilting forward; the window was widening, he felt his body leave his bed, and he was pitched headfirst through the opening in the page, into a whirl of color and shadow.  He felt his feet hit solid ground, and stood, shaking, as the blurred shapes around him came suddenly into focus.  He knew immediately where he was. This circular room with the sleeping portraits was Dumbledore's office - but it wasn't Dumbledore who was sitting behind the desk. A wizened, fraillooking wizard, bald except for a few wisps of white hair, was reading a letter by candlelight. Harry had never seen this man before.  \\\\\\\"I'm sorry,\\\\\\\" he said shakily. \\\\\\\"I didn't mean to butt in -\\\\\\\"  But the wizard didn't look up. He continued to read, frowning slightly. Harry drew nearer to his desk and stammered, \\\\\\\"Er - I'll just go, shall I?\\\\\\\"  Still the wizard ignored him. He didn't seem even to have heard him. Thinking that the wizard might be deaf, Harry raised his voice.  *242*  \\\\\\\"Sorry I disturbed you. I'll go now,\\\\\\\" he half-shouted.  The wizard folded up the letter with a sigh, stood up, walked past Harry without glancing at him, and went to draw the curtains at his window.  The sky outside the window was ruby-red; it seemed to be sunset. The wizard went back to the desk, sat down, and twiddled his thumbs, watching the door.  Harry looked around the office. No Fawkes the phoenix - no whirring silver contraptions. This was Hogwarts as Riddle had known it, meaning that this unknown wizard was Headmaster, not Dumbledore, and he, Harry, was little more than a phantom, completely invisible to the people of fifty years ago.  There was a knock on the office door.  \\\\\\\"Enter,\\\\\\\" said the old wizard in a feeble voice.  A boy of about sixteen entered, taking off his pointed hat. A silver prefect's badge was glinting on his chest. He was much taller than Harry, but he, too, had jet-black hair.  \\\\\\\"Ah, Riddle,\\\\\\\" said the Headmaster.  \\\\\\\"You wanted to see me, Professor Dippet?\\\\\\\" said Riddle. He looked nervous.  \\\\\\\"Sit down,\\\\\\\" said Dippet. \\\\\\\"I've just been reading the letter you sent me.  \\\\\\\"Oh,\\\\\\\" said Riddle. He sat down, gripping his hands together very tightly.  \\\\\\\"My dear boy,\\\\\\\" said Dipper kindly, \\\\\\\"I cannot possibly let you stay at school over the summer. Surely you want to go home for the holidays?\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"No,\\\\\\\" said Riddle at once. \\\\\\\"Id much rather stay at Hogwarts than go back to that - to that -\\\\\\\"  * 243*  \\\\\\\"You live in a Muggle orphanage during the holidays, I believe?\\\\\\\" said Dippet curiously.  \\\\\\\"Yes, sir,\\\\\\\" said Riddle, reddening slightly.  \\\\\\\"You are Muggle-born?\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"Half-blood, sir,\\\\\\\" said Riddle. \\\\\\\"Muggle father, witch mother.\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"And are both your parents -?\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"My mother died just after I was born, sir. They told me at the orphanage she lived just long enough to name me - Tom after my father, Marvolo after my grandfather.\\\\\\\"  Dipper clucked his tongue sympathetically.  \\\\\\\"The thing is, Tom,\\\\\\\" he sighed, \\\\\\\"Special arrangements might have been made for you, but in the current circumstances . . . .\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"You mean all these attacks, sir?\\\\\\\" said Riddle, and Harry's heart leapt, and he moved closer, scared of missing anything.  \\\\\\\"Precisely,\\\\\\\" said the headmaster. \\\\\\\"My dear boy, you must see how foolish it would be of me to allow you to remain at the castle when term ends. Particularly in light of the recent tragedy ... the death of that poor little girl .... You will be safer by far at your orphanage. As a matter of fact, the Ministry of Magic is even now talking about closing the school. We are no nearer locating the er - source of all this unpleasantness . . . .\\\\\\\"  Riddle's eyes had widened.  \\\\\\\"Sir - if the person was caught - if it all stopped -\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"What do you mean?\\\\\\\" said Dippet with a squeak in his voice, sitting up in his chair. \\\\\\\"Riddle, do you mean you know something about these attacks?\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"No, sir,\\\\\\\" said Riddle quickly.  But Harry was sure it was the same sort of \\\\\\\"no\\\\\\\" that he himself had given Dumbledore.  *244*\\\"\",\n          \"\\u00a0Harry felt as though he too were hurtling through space; it had not happened. . . . It could not have happened. ...\\\\Out of here, quickly,\\\\\\\" said Snape.He seized Malfoy by the scruff of the neck and forced him through the door ahead of the rest; Greyback and the squat brother and sister followed, the latter both panting excitedly. As they vanished through the door, Harry realized he could move again. What was now holding him paralyzed against the wall was not magic, but horror and shock. He threw the Invisibility Cloak aside as the brutal-faced Death Eater, last to leave the tower top, was disappearing through the door.\\u00a0\\\\\\\"Petrificus Totalus!\\\\\\\"\\u00a0The Death Eater buckled as though hit in the back with something solid and fell to the ground, rigid as a waxwork, but he had barely hit the floor when Harry was clambering over him and running down the darkened staircase.\\u00a0Terror tore at Harry;s heart. ... He had to get to Dumbledore and he had to catch Snape. ... Somehow the two things were linked. ... He could reverse what had happened if he had them both together. ... Dumbledore could not have died. ...He leapt the last ten steps of the spiral staircase and stopped where he landed, his wand raised. The dimly lit corridor was full of dust; half the ceiling seemed to have fallen in; and a battle was raging before him, but even as he attempted to make out who were fighting whom, he heard the hated voice shout, \\\\\\\"It's over, time to go!\\\\\\\" and saw Snape disappearing around the corner at the far end of the corridor; he and Malfoy seemed to have forced their way through the fight unscathed. As Harry plunged after them, one of the fighters detached themselves from the fray and flew at him: it was the werewolf, Fenrir. He was on top of Harry before Harry could raise his wand: Harry fell backward, with filthy matted hair in his face, the stench of sweat and blood filling his nose and mouth, hot greedy breath at his throat -\\\\\\\"Petrificus Totalus!\\\\\\\"Harry felt Fenrir collapse against him; with a stupendous effort he pushed the werewolf off and onto the floor as a jet of green light came flying toward him; he ducked and ran, headfirst, into the fight. His feet met something squashy and slippery on the floor and he stumbled: There were two bodies lying there, lying facedown in a pool of blood, but there was no time to investigate. Harry now saw red hair flying like flames in front of him: Ginny was locked in combat with the lumpy Death Eater, Amycus, who was throwing hex after hex at her while she dodged them: Amycus was giggling, enjoying the sport: \\\\\\\"Crucio - Crucio - you can't dance forever, pretty-\\\\\\\"\\u00a0\\\\\\\"Impedimenta!\\\\\\\" yelled Harry.His jinx hit Amycus in the chest: He gave a piglike squeal of pain, was lifted off his feet and slammed into the opposite wall, slid down it, and fell out of sight behind Ron, Professor McGonagall, and Lupin, each of whom was battling a separate Death Eater. Beyond them, Harry saw Tonks fighting an enormous blond wizard who was sending curses flying in all directions, so that they ricocheted off the walls around them, cracking stone, shattering the nearest window -\\\\\\\"Harry, where did you come from?\\\\\\\" Ginny cried, but there was no time to answer her. He put his head down and sprinted forward, narrowly avoiding a blast that erupted over his head, showering them all in bits of wall. Snape must not escape, he must catch up with Snape -\\\\\\\"Take that!\\\\\\\" shouted Professor McGonagall, and Harry glimpsed the female Death Eater, Alecto, sprinting away down the corridor with her arms over her head, her brother right behind her. He launched himself after them but his foot caught on something, and next moment he was lying across someone's legs. Looking around, he saw Neville's pale, round face flat against the floor. \\\\\\\"Neville, are you - ?\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"M'all right,\\\\\\\" muttered Neville, who was clutching his stomach, \\\\\\\"Harry . . . Snape 'n' Malfoy . . . ran past. . .\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"I know, I'm on it!\\\\\\\" said Harry, aiming a hex from the floor at the enormous blond Death Eater who was causing most of the chaos. The man gave a howl of pain as the spell hit him in the face: He wheeled around, staggered, and then pounded away after the brother and sister. Harry scrambled up from the floor and began to sprint along the corridor, ignoring the bangs issuing from behind him, the yells of the others to come back, and the mute call of the figures on the ground whose fate he did not yet know. . . .He skidded around the corner, his trainers slippery with blood; Snape had an immense head start. Was it possible that he had already entered the cabinet in the Room of Requirement, or had the Order made steps to secure it, to prevent the Death Eaters retreating that way? He could hear nothing but his own pounding feet, his own hammering heart as he sprinted along the next empty corridor, but then spotted a bloody footprint that showed at least one of the fleeing Death Eaters was heading toward the front doors - perhaps the Room of Requirement was indeed blocked -He skidded around another corner and a curse flew past him; he dived behind a suit of armor that exploded. He saw the brother and sister running down the marble staircase ahead and aimed jinxes at them, but merely hit several bewigged witches in a portrait on the landing, who ran screeching into neighboring paintings. As he leapt the wreckage of armor, Harry heard more shouts and screams; other people within the castle seemed to have awoken. . . .He pelted toward a shortcut, hoping to overtake the brother and sister and close in on Snape and Malfoy, who must surely have reached the grounds by now. Remembering to leap the vanishing step halfway down the concealed staircase, he burst through a tapestry at the bottom and out into a corridor where a number of bewildered and pajama-clad Hufflepuffs stood.\\\\\\\"Harry! We heard a noise, and someone said something aboui the Dark Mark -\\\\\\\" began Ernie Macmillan.\\\\\\\"Out of the way!\\\\\\\" yelled Harry, knocking two boys aside as he sprinted toward the landing and down the remainder of the marble staircase. The oak front doors had been blasted open, there were smears of blood on the flagstones, and several terrified students stood huddled against the walls, one or two still cowering with their arms over their faces. The giant Gryffindor hourglass had been hit by a curse, and the rubies within were still falling, with a loud rattle, onto the flagstones below.Harry flew across the entrance hall and out into the dark grounds: He could just make out three figures racing across the lawn, heading for the gates beyond which they could Disapparate - by the looks of them, the huge blond Death Eater and, some way ahead of him, Snape and Malfoy. ...The cold night air ripped at Harry's lungs as he tore after them; he saw a flash of light in the distance that momentarily silhouetted his quarry. He did not know what it was but continued to run, not yet near enough to get a good aim with a curse -Another flash, shouts, retaliatory jets of light, and Harry understood: Hagrid had emerged from his cabin and was trying to stop the Death Eaters escaping, and though every breath seemed to shred his lungs and the stitch in his chest was like fire, Harry sped up as an unbidden voice in his head said: not Hagrid. . . not Hagrid too . . .Something caught Harry hard in the small of the back and he fell forward, his face smacking the ground, blood pouring out of both nostrils: He knew, even as he rolled over, his wand ready, that the brother and sister he had overtaken using his shortcut were closing in behind him. . . .\\\\\\\"Impedimenta!\\\\\\\" he yelled as he rolled over again, crouching close to the dark ground, and miraculously his jinx hit one of them, who stumbled and fell, tripping up the other; Harry leapt to his feet and sprinted on after Snape.And now he saw the vast outline of Hagrid, illuminated by the light of the crescent moon revealed suddenly behind clouds; the blond Death Eater was aiming curse after curse at the gamekeeper; but Hagrids immense strength and the toughened skin he had inherited from his giantess mother seemed to be protecting him. Snape and Malfoy, however, were still running; they would soon be beyond the gates, able to Disapparate -Harry tore past Hagrid and his opponent, took aim at Snape's back, and yelled, \\\\\\\"Stupefy!\\\\\\\"He missed; the jet of red light soared past Snape's head; Snape shouted, \\\\\\\"Run, Draco!\\\\\\\"and turned. Twenty yards apart, he and Harry looked at each other before raising their wands simultaneously.\\\\\\\"Cruc - \\\\\\\"But Snape parried the curse, knocking Harry backward off his feet before he could complete it; Harry rolled over and scrambled back up again as the huge Death Eater behind him yelled, \\\\\\\"Incendio!\\\\\\\" Harry heard an explosive bang and a dancing orange light spilled over all of them: Hagrid's house was on fire.\\\\\\\"Fang's in there, yer evil - !\\\\\\\" Hagrid bellowed.\\\\\\\"Cruc -\\\\\\\" yelled Harry for the second time, aiming for the figure ahead illuminated in the dancing firelight, but Snape blocked the spell again. Harry could see him sneering.\\\\\\\"No Unforgivable Curses from you, Potter!\\\\\\\" he shouted over the rushing of the flames, Hagrid's yells, and the wild yelping of the trapped Fang. \\\\\\\"You haven't got the nerve or the ability -\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"Incarc-\\\\\\\"Harry roared, but Snape deflected the spell with an almost lazy flick of his arm.\\\\\\\"Fight back!\\\\\\\" Harry screamed at him. \\\\\\\"Fight back, you cowardly-----\\\\\\\"\\u00a0\\\\\\\"Coward, did you call me, Potter?\\\\\\\" shouted Snape. \\\\\\\"Your father would never attack me unless it was four on one, what would you call him, I wonder?\\\\\\\" \\\\\\\"Stupe-\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"Blocked again and again and again until you learn to keep your mouth shut and your mind closed, Potter!\\\\\\\" sneered Snape, deflecting the curse once more. \\\\\\\"Now come!\\\\\\\" he shouted at the huge Death Eater behind Harry. \\\\\\\"It is time to be gone, before the Ministry turns up -\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"Impedi -\\\\\\\"But before he could finish this jinx, excruciating pain hit Harry; he keeled over in the grass. Someone was screaming, he would surely die of this agony, Snape was going to torture him to death or madness -\\\\\\\"No!\\\\\\\" roared Snape's voice and the pain stopped as suddenly as it had started; Harry lay curled on the dark grass, clutching his wand and panting; somewhere overhead Snape was shouting, \\\\\\\"Have you forgotten our orders? Potter belongs to the Dark Lord - we are to leave him! Go! Go!\\\\\\\"And Harry felt the ground shudder under his face as the brother and sister and the enormous Death Eater obeyed, running toward the gates. Harry uttered an inarticulate yell of rage: In that instant, he cared not whether he lived or died. Pushing himself to his feet again, he staggered blindly toward Snape, the man he now hated as much as he hated Voldemort himself -\\u00a0\\\\\\\"Sectum - \\\\\\\"Snape flicked his wand and the curse was repelled yet again; but Harry was mere feet away now and he could see Snape's face clearly at last: He was no longer sneering or jeering; the blazing flames showed a face full of rage. Mustering all his powers of concentration, Harry thought, Levi -\\\\\\\"No, Potter!\\\\\\\" screamed Snape. There was a loud BANG and Harry was soaring backward, hitting the ground hard again, ;un\\\\ this time his wand flew out of his hand. He could hear Hagrid yelling and Fang howling as Snape closed in and looked down on him where he lay, wandless and defenseless as Dumbledore hadl been. Snape's pale face, illuminated by the flaming cabin, was suffused with hatred just as it had been before he had cursed Dumbledore.\\\\\\\"You dare use my own spells against me, Potter? It was I who invented them - I, the Half-Blood Prince! And you'd turn my inventions on me, like your filthy father, would you? I don't think so . . . no\\\\\\\"Harry had dived for his wand; Snape shot a hex at it and it flew feet away into the darkness and out of sight.\\\\\\\"Kill me then,\\\\\\\" panted Harry, who felt no fear at all, but only rage and contempt. \\\\\\\"Kill me like you killed him, you coward -\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"DON'T -\\\\\\\" screamed Snape, and his face was suddenly demented, inhuman, as though he was in as much pain as the yelping, howling dog stuck in the burning house behind them - \\\\\\\"CALL ME COWARD!\\\\\\\"And he slashed at the air: Harry felt a white-hot, whiplike something hit him across the face and was slammed backward into the ground. Spots of light burst in front of his eyes and for a moment all the breath seemed to have gone from his body, then he heard a rush of wings above him and something enormous obscured the stars. Buckbeak had flown at Snape, who staggered backward as the razor-sharp claws slashed at him. As Harry raised himself into a sitting position, his head still swimming from its last contact with the ground, he saw Snape running as hard as he could, the enormous beast flapping behind him and screeching as Harry had never heard him screech -Harry struggled to his feet, looking around groggily for his wand, hoping to give chase again, but even as his fingers fumbled in the grass, discarding twigs, he knew it would be too late, and sure enough, by the time he had located his wand, he turned only to see the hippogriff circling the gates. Snape had managed to Disapparate just beyond the school's boundaries.\\\\\\\"Hagrid,\\\\\\\" muttered Harry, still dazed, looking around. \\\\\\\"HAGRID?\\\\\\\"He stumbled toward the burning house as an enormous figure emerged from out of the flames carrying Fang on his back. With a cry of thankfulness, Harry sank to his knees; he was shaking in every limb, his body ached all over, and his breath came in painful stabs.\\\\\\\"Yeh all righ', Harry? Yeh all righ'? Speak ter me, Harry. . ..\\\\\\\"Hagrids huge, hairy face was swimming above Harry, blocking out the stars. Harry could smell burnt wood and dog hair; he put out a hand and felt Fang's reassuringly warm and alive body quivering beside him.\\\\\\\"I'm all right,\\\\\\\" panted Harry. \\\\\\\"Are you?\\\\\\\" \\\\\\\"'Course I am . . . take more'n that ter finish me.\\\\\\\"Hagrid put his hands under Harry's arms and raised him up with such force that Harry's feet momentarily left the ground before Hagrid set him upright again. He could see blood trickling down Hagrid's cheek from a deep cut under one eye, which was swelling rapidly.\\\\\\\"We should put out your house,\\\\\\\" said Harry, \\\\\\\"the charm's 'Aguamenti' ...\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"Knew it was summat like that,\\\\\\\" mumbled Hagrid, and he raised a smoldering pink, flowery umbrella and said, \\\\\\\"Aguamenti!\\\\\\\"A jet of water flew out of the umbrella tip. Harry raised his wand arm, which felt like lead, and murmured \\\\\\\"Aguamenti\\\\\\\" too: Together, he and Hagrid poured water on the house until the last flame was extinguished.\\\\\\\"S'not too bad,\\\\\\\" said Hagrid hopefully a few minutes later, looking at the smoking wreck. \\\\\\\"Nothin Dumbledore won' be able to put righ' . . .\\\\\\\"Harry felt a searing pain in his stomach at the sound of the name. In the silence and the stillness, horror rose inside him.\\\\\\\"Hagrid ...\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"I was bindin' up a couple o' bowtruckle legs when I heard 'em coming,\\\\\\\" said Hagrid sadly, still staring at his wrecked cabin. \\\\\\\"They'll bin burnt ter twigs, poor little things. . . .\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"Hagrid . . .\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"But what happened, Harry? I jus' saw them Death Eaters run-nin down from the castle, but what the ruddy hell was Snape doin' with 'em? Where's he gone - was he chasin' them?\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"He . . .\\\\\\\" Harry cleared his throat; it was dry from panic and the smoke. \\\\\\\"Hagrid, he killed . . .\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"Killed?\\\\\\\" said Hagrid loudly, staring down at Harry. \\\\\\\"Snape killed? What're yeh on abou', Harry?\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"Dumbledore,\\\\\\\" said Harry. \\\\\\\"Snape killed .. . Dumbledore.\\\\\\\"Hagrid simply looked at him, the little of his face that could be seen completely blank, uncomprehending.\\\\\\\"Dumbledore wha, Harry?\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"He's dead. Snape killed him....\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"Don' say that,\\\\\\\" said Hagrid roughly. \\\\\\\"Snape kill Dumbledore - don' be stupid, Harry. Wha's made yeh say tha'?\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"I saw it happen.\\\\\\\" , ,..\\\\\\\"Yeh couldn' have.\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"I saw it, Hagrid.\\\\\\\"Hagrid shook his head; his expression was disbelieving but sympathetic, and Harry knew that Hagrid thought he had sustained a blow to the head, that he was confused, perhaps by the aftereffects of a jinx. ...\\\\\\\"What musta happened was, Dumbledore musta told Snape ter go with them Death Eaters,\\\\\\\" Hagrid said confidently. \\\\\\\"I suppose he's gotta keep his cover. Look, let's get yeh back up ter the school. Come on, Harry. ...\\\\\\\"Harry did not attempt to argue or explain. He was still shaking uncontrollably. Hagrid would find out soon enough, too soon. ... As they directed their steps back toward the castle, Harry saw that many of its windows were lit now. He could imagine, clearly, the scenes inside as people moved from room to room, telling each other that Death Eaters had got in, that the Mark was shining over Hogwarts, that somebody must have been killed. . . .The oak front doors stood open ahead of them, light flooding out onto the drive and the lawn. Slowly, uncertainly, dressing-gowned people were creeping down the steps, looking around nervously for some sign of the Death Eaters who had fled into the night. Harry's eyes, however, were fixed upon the ground at the foot of the tallest tower. He imagined that he could see a black, huddled mass lying in the grass there, though he was really too far away to see anything of the sort. Even as he stared wordlessly at the place where he thoughtDumbledore's body must lie, however, he saw people beginning to move toward it.\\\\\\\"What're they all lookin' at?\\\\\\\" said Hagrid, as he and Harry approached the castle front, Fang keeping as close as he could to their ankles. \\\\\\\"Wha's that lyin' on the grass?\\\\\\\" Hagrid added sharply, heading now toward the foot of the Astronomy Tower, where a small crowd was congregating. \\\\\\\"See it, Harry? Right at the foot of the tower? Under where the Mark . . . Blimey . . . yeh don' think someone got thrown - ?\\\\\\\"Hagrid fell silent, the thought apparently too horrible to express aloud. Harry walked alongside him, feeling the aches and pains in his face and his legs where the various hexes of the last half hour had hit him, though in an oddly detached way, as though somebody near him was suffering them. What was real and inescapable was the awful pressing feeling in his chest. . . .He and Hagrid moved, dreamlike, through the murmuring crowd to the very front, where the dumbstruck students and teachers had left a gap.Harry heard Hagrid's moan of pain and shock, but he did not stop; he walked slowly forward until he reached the place where Dumbledore lay and crouched down beside him. He had known there was no hope from the moment that the full Body-Bind Curse Dumbledore had placed upon him lifted, known that it could have happened only because its caster was dead, but there was still no preparation for seeing him here, spread-eagled, broken: the greatest wizard Harry had ever, or would ever, meet.Dumbledore's eyes were closed; but for the strange angle of his arms and legs, he might have been sleeping. Harry reached out, straightened the half-moon spectacles upon the crooked nose, and wiped a trickle of blood from the mouth with his own sleeve. Then he gazed down at the wise old face and tried to absorb the enormous and incomprehensible truth: that never again would Dumbledore speak to him, never again could he help-----The crowd murmured behind Harry. After what seemed like a long time, he became aware that he was kneeling upon something hard and looked down.The locket they had managed to steal so many hours before had fallen out of Dumbledore's pocket. It had opened, perhaps due to the force with which it hit the ground. And although he could not feel more shock or horror or sadness than he felt already, Harry knew, as he picked it up, that there was something wrong-----He turned the locket over in his hands. This was neither as large as the locket he remembered seeing in the Pensieve, nor were there any markings upon it, no sign of the ornate S that was supposed to be Slytherins mark. Moreover, there was nothing inside but for a scrap of folded parchment wedged tightly into the place where a portrait should have been.Automatically, without really thinking about what he was doing, Harry pulled out the fragment of parchment, opened it, and read by the light of the many wands that had now been lit behind him:\\u00a0To the Dark LordI now I will be dead long before you read this but I want you to know that it was I who dicovered your secret. I have stolen the real Horcrux and intend to destroy it as soon as I can.\\u00a0I face death in the hope that when you meet your match you will be mortal once more.R.A.B.\\u00a0Harry neither knew nor cared what the message meant. Only one thing mattered: This was not a Horcrux. Dumbledore had weakened himself by drinking that terrible potion for nothing. Harry crumpled the parchment in his hand, and his eyes burned with tears as behind him Fang began to howl.\\\"\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Chapter\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 11,\n        \"min\": 8,\n        \"max\": 37,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 7,\n        \"samples\": [\n          8,\n          14,\n          28\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Book\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 2,\n        \"min\": 1,\n        \"max\": 7,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 7,\n        \"samples\": [\n          1,\n          2,\n          6\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Tokens\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"WordCount\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 872,\n        \"min\": 1703,\n        \"max\": 3907,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 7,\n        \"samples\": [\n          3155,\n          2450,\n          3650\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

Although he could tell it was daylight, he kept his eyes shut tight.  \\\\It was a dream, he told himself firmly. \\\\\\\"I dreamed a giant called Hagrid came to tell me I was going to a school for wizards. When I open my eyes I'll be at home in my cupboard.\\\\\\\"  There was suddenly a loud tapping noise.  And there's Aunt Petunia knocking on the door, Harry thought, his heart sinking. But he still didn't open his eyes. It had been such a good dream.  Tap. Tap. Tap.  \\\\\\\"All right,\\\\\\\" Harry mumbled, \\\\\\\"I'm getting up.\\\\\\\"  He sat up and Hagrid's heavy coat fell off him. The hut was full of sunlight, the storm was over, Hagrid himself was asleep on the collapsed sofa, and there was an owl rapping its claw on the window, a newspaper held in its beak.  Harry scrambled to his feet, so happy he felt as though a large balloon was swelling inside him. He went straight to the window and jerked it open. The owl swooped in and dropped the newspaper on top of Hagrid, who didn't wake up. The owl then fluttered onto the floor and began to attack Hagrid's coat.  \\\\\\\"Don't do that.\\\\\\\"  Harry tried to wave the owl out of the way, but it snapped its beak fiercely at him and carried on savaging the coat.  \\\\\\\"Hagrid!\\\\\\\" said Harry loudly. \\\\\\\"There's an owl  \\\\\\\"Pay him,\\\\\\\" Hagrid grunted into the sofa.  \\\\\\\"What?\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"He wants payin' fer deliverin' the paper. Look in the pockets.\\\\\\\" Hagrid's coat seemed to be made of nothing but pockets -- bunches of keys, slug pellets, balls of string, peppermint humbugs, teabags... finally, Harry pulled out a handful of strange-looking coins.  \\\\\\\"Give him five Knuts,\\\\\\\" said Hagrid sleepily.  \\\\\\\"Knuts?\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"The little bronze ones.\\\\\\\"  Harry counted out five little bronze coins, and the owl held out his leg so Harry could put the money into a small leather pouch tied to it. Then he flew off through the open window.  Hagrid yawned loudly, sat up, and stretched.  \\\\\\\"Best be Off, Harry, lots ter do today, gotta get up ter London an' buy all yer stuff fer school.\\\\\\\"  Harry was turning over the wizard coins and looking at them. He had just thought of something that made him feel as though the happy balloon inside him had got a puncture.  \\\\\\\"Um -- Hagrid?\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"Mm?\\\\\\\" said Hagrid, who was pulling on his huge boots.  \\\\\\\"I haven't got any money -- and you heard Uncle Vernon last night ... he won't pay for me to go and learn magic.\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"Don't worry about that,\\\\\\\" said Hagrid, standing up and scratching his head. \\\\\\\"D'yeh think yer parents didn't leave yeh anything?\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"But if their house was destroyed --\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"They didn' keep their gold in the house, boy! Nah, first stop fer us is Gringotts. Wizards' bank. Have a sausage, they're not bad cold -- an' I wouldn' say no teh a bit o' yer birthday cake, neither.\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"Wizards have banks?\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"Just the one. Gringotts. Run by goblins.\\\\\\\"  Harry dropped the bit of sausage he was holding.  \\\\\\\"Goblins?\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"Yeah -- so yeh'd be mad ter try an' rob it, I'll tell yeh that. Never mess with goblins, Harry. Gringotts is the safest place in the world fer anything yeh want ter keep safe -- 'cept maybe Hogwarts. As a matter o' fact, I gotta visit Gringotts anyway. Fer Dumbledore. Hogwarts business.\\\\\\\" Hagrid drew himself up proudly. \\\\\\\"He usually gets me ter do important stuff fer him. Fetchin' you gettin' things from Gringotts -- knows he can trust me, see.  \\\\\\\"Got everythin'? Come on, then.\\\\\\\"  Harry followed Hagrid out onto the rock. The sky was quite clear now and the sea gleamed in the sunlight. The boat Uncle Vernon had hired was still there, with a lot of water in the bottom after the storm.  \\\\\\\"How did you get here?\\\\\\\" Harry asked, looking around for another boat. \\\\\\\"Flew,\\\\\\\" said Hagrid.  \\\\\\\"Flew?\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"Yeah -- but we'll go back in this. Not s'pposed ter use magic now I've got yeh.\\\\\\\"  They settled down in the boat, Harry still staring at Hagrid, trying to imagine him flying.  \\\\\\\"Seems a shame ter row, though,\\\\\\\" said Hagrid, giving Harry another of his sideways looks. \\\\\\\"If I was ter -- er -- speed things up a bit, would yeh mind not mentionin' it at Hogwarts?\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"Of course not,\\\\\\\" said Harry, eager to see more magic. Hagrid pulled out the pink umbrella again, tapped it twice on the side of the boat, and they sped off toward land.  \\\\\\\"Why would you be mad to try and rob Gringotts?\\\\\\\" Harry asked.  \\\\\\\"Spells -- enchantments,\\\\\\\" said Hagrid, unfolding his newspaper as he spoke. \\\\\\\"They say there's dragons guardin' the highsecurity vaults. And then yeh gotta find yer way -- Gringotts is hundreds of miles under London, see. Deep under the Underground. Yeh'd die of hunger tryin' ter get out, even if yeh did manage ter get yer hands on summat.\\\\\\\"  Harry sat and thought about this while Hagrid read his newspaper, the Daily Prophet. Harry had learned from Uncle Vernon that people liked to be left alone while they did this, but it was very difficult, he'd never had so many questions in his life.  \\\\\\\"Ministry o' Magic messin' things up as usual,\\\\\\\" Hagrid muttered, turning the page.  \\\\\\\"There's a Ministry of Magic?\\\\\\\" Harry asked, before he could stop himself.  \\\\\\\"'Course,\\\\\\\" said Hagrid. \\\\\\\"They wanted Dumbledore fer Minister, 0 ' course, but he'd never leave Hogwarts, so old Cornelius Fudge got the job. Bungler if ever there was one. So he pelts Dumbledore with owls every morning, askin' fer advice.\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"But what does a Ministry of Magic do?\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"Well, their main job is to keep it from the Muggles that there's still witches an' wizards up an' down the country.\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"Why?\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"Why? Blimey, Harry, everyone'd be wantin' magic solutions to their problems. Nah, we're best left alone.\\\\\\\"  At this moment the boat bumped gently into the harbor wall. Hagrid folded up his newspaper, and they clambered up the stone steps onto the street.  Passersby stared a lot at Hagrid as they walked through the little town to the station. Harry couldn't blame them. Not only was Hagrid twice as tall as anyone else, he kept pointing at perfectly ordinary things like parking meters and saying loudly, \\\\\\\"See that, Harry? Things these Muggles dream up, eh?\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"Hagrid,\\\\\\\" said Harry, panting a bit as he ran to keep up, \\\\\\\"did you say there are dragons at Gringotts?\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"Well, so they say,\\\\\\\" said Hagrid. \\\\\\\"Crikey, I'd like a dragon.\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"You'd like one?\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"Wanted one ever since I was a kid -- here we go.\\\\\\\"  They had reached the station. There was a train to London in five minutes' time. Hagrid, who didn't understand \\\\\\\"Muggle money,\\\\\\\" as he called it, gave the bills to Harry so he could buy their tickets.  People stared more than ever on the train. Hagrid took up two seats and sat knitting what looked like a canary-yellow circus tent.  \\\\\\\"Still got yer letter, Harry?\\\\\\\" he asked as he counted stitches. Harry took the parchment envelope out of his pocket.  \\\\\\\"Good,\\\\\\\" said Hagrid. \\\\\\\"There's a list there of everything yeh need.\\\\\\\"  Harry unfolded a second piece of paper he hadn't noticed the night before, and read:  HOGWARTS SCHOOL of WITCHCRAFT and WIZARDRY  UNIFORM  First-year students will require:  1. Three sets of plain work robes (black)  2. One plain pointed hat (black) for day wear  3. One pair of protective gloves (dragon hide or similar)  4. One winter cloak (black, silver fastenings)  Please note that all pupils' clothes should carry name tags  COURSE BOOKS  All students should have a copy of each of the following:  The Standard Book of Spells (Grade 1) by Miranda Goshawk  A History of Magic by Bathilda Bagshot  Magical Theory by Adalbert Waffling  A Beginners' Guide to Transfiguration by Emetic Switch  One Thousand Magical Herbs and Fungi by Phyllida Spore  Magical Drafts and Potions by Arsenius Jigger  Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them by Newt Scamander  The Dark Forces: A Guide to Self-Protection by Quentin Trimble  OTHER EQUIPMENT  wand cauldron (pewter, standard size 2) set  glass or crystal phials  telescope set  brass scales  Students may also bring an owl OR a cat OR a toad  PARENTS ARE REMINDED THAT FIRST YEARS ARE NOT ALLOWED THEIR OWN BROOMSTICKS  \\\\\\\"Can we buy all this in London?\\\\\\\" Harry wondered aloud.  \\\\\\\"If yeh know where to go,\\\\\\\" said Hagrid.  Harry had never been to London before. Although Hagrid seemed to know where he was going, he was obviously not used to getting there in an ordinary way. He got stuck in the ticket barrier on the Underground, and complained loudly that the seats were too small and the trains too slow.  \\\\\\\"I don't know how the Muggles manage without magic,\\\\\\\" he said as they climbed a broken-down escalator that led up to a bustling road lined with shops.  Hagrid was so huge that he parted the crowd easily; all Harry had to do was keep close behind him. They passed book shops and music stores, hamburger restaurants and cinemas, but nowhere that looked as if it could sell you a magic wand. This was just an ordinary street full of ordinary people. Could there really be piles of wizard gold buried miles beneath them? Were there really shops that sold spell books and broomsticks? Might this not all be some huge joke that the Dursleys had cooked up? If Harry hadn't known that the Dursleys had no sense of humor, he might have thought so; yet somehow, even though everything Hagrid had told him so far was unbelievable, Harry couldn't help trusting him.  \\\\\\\"This is it,\\\\\\\" said Hagrid, coming to a halt, \\\\\\\"the Leaky Cauldron. It's a famous place.\\\\\\\"  It was a tiny, grubby-looking pub. If Hagrid hadn't pointed it out, Harry wouldn't have noticed it was there. The people hurrying by didn't glance at it. Their eyes slid from the big book shop on one side to the record shop on the other as if they couldn't see the Leaky Cauldron at all. In fact, Harry had the most peculiar feeling that only he and Hagrid could see it. Before he could mention this, Hagrid had steered him inside.  For a famous place, it was very dark and shabby. A few old women were sitting in a corner, drinking tiny glasses of sherry. One of them was smoking a long pipe. A little man in a top hat was talking to the old bartender, who was quite bald and looked like a toothless walnut. The low buzz of chatter stopped when they walked in. Everyone seemed to know Hagrid; they waved and smiled at him, and the bartender reached for a glass, saying, \\\\\\\"The usual, Hagrid?\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"Can't, Tom, I'm on Hogwarts business,\\\\\\\" said Hagrid, clapping his great hand on Harry's shoulder and making Harry's knees buckle.  \\\\\\\"Good Lord,\\\\\\\" said the bartender, peering at Harry, \\\\\\\"is this -- can this be --?\\\\\\\"  The Leaky Cauldron had suddenly gone completely still and silent.  \\\\\\\"Bless my soul,\\\\\\\" whispered the old bartender, \\\\\\\"Harry Potter... what an honor.\\\\\\\"  He hurried out from behind the bar, rushed toward Harry and seized his hand, tears in his eyes.  \\\\\\\"Welcome back, Mr. Potter, welcome back.\\\\\\\"  Harry didn't know what to say. Everyone was looking at him. The old woman with the pipe was puffing on it without realizing it had gone out. Hagrid was beaming.  Then there was a great scraping of chairs and the next moment, Harry found himself shaking hands with everyone in the Leaky Cauldron.  \\\\\\\"Doris Crockford, Mr. Potter, can't believe I'm meeting you at last.\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"So proud, Mr. Potter, I'm just so proud.\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"Always wanted to shake your hand -- I'm all of a flutter.\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"Delighted, Mr. Potter, just can't tell you, Diggle's the name, Dedalus Diggle.\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"I've seen you before!\\\\\\\" said Harry, as Dedalus Diggle's top hat fell off in his excitement. \\\\\\\"You bowed to me once in a shop.\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"He remembers!\\\\\\\" cried Dedalus Diggle, looking around at everyone. \\\\\\\"Did you hear that? He remembers me!\\\\\\\" Harry shook hands again and again -- Doris Crockford kept coming back for more.  A pale young man made his way forward, very nervously. One of his eyes was twitching.  \\\\\\\"Professor Quirrell!\\\\\\\" said Hagrid. \\\\\\\"Harry, Professor Quirrell will be one of your teachers at Hogwarts.\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"P-P-Potter,\\\\\\\" stammered Professor Quirrell, grasping Harry's hand, \\\\\\\"c-can't t-tell you how p- pleased I am to meet you.\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"What sort of magic do you teach, Professor Quirrell?\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"D-Defense Against the D-D-Dark Arts,\\\\\\\" muttered Professor Quirrell, as though he'd rather not think about it. \\\\\\\"N-not that you n-need it, eh, P-P-Potter?\\\\\\\" He laughed nervously. \\\\\\\"You'll be g-getting all your equipment, I suppose? I've g-got to p-pick up a new b-book on vampires, m-myself.\\\\\\\" He looked terrified at the very thought.  But the others wouldn't let Professor Quirrell keep Harry to himself. It took almost ten minutes to get away from them all. At last, Hagrid managed to make himself heard over the babble.  \\\\\\\"Must get on -- lots ter buy. Come on, Harry.\\\\\\\"  Doris Crockford shook Harry's hand one last time, and Hagrid led them through the bar and out into a small, walled courtyard, where there was nothing but a trash can and a few weeds.  Hagrid grinned at Harry.  \\\\\\\"Told yeh, didn't I? Told yeh you was famous. Even Professor Quirrell was tremblin' ter meet yeh -- mind you, he's usually tremblin'.\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"Is he always that nervous?\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"Oh, yeah. Poor bloke. Brilliant mind. He was fine while he was  studyin' outta books but then he took a year off ter get some firsthand experience.... They say he met vampires in the Black Forest, and there was a nasty bit o' trouble with a hag -- never been the same since. Scared of the students, scared of his own subject now, where's me umbrella?\\\\\\\"  Vampires? Hags? Harry's head was swimming. Hagrid, meanwhile, was counting bricks in the wall above the trash can.  \\\\\\\"Three up... two across he muttered. \\\\\\\"Right, stand back, Harry.\\\\\\\"  He tapped the wall three times with the point of his umbrella.  The brick he had touched quivered -- it wriggled -- in the middle, a small hole appeared -- it grew wider and wider -- a second later they were facing an archway large enough even for Hagrid, an archway onto a cobbled street that twisted and turned out of sight.  \\\\\\\"Welcome,\\\\\\\" said Hagrid, \\\\\\\"to Diagon Alley.\\\\\\\"  He grinned at Harry's amazement. They stepped through the archway. Harry looked quickly over his shoulder and saw the archway shrink instantly back into solid wall.  The sun shone brightly on a stack of cauldrons outside the nearest shop. Cauldrons -- All Sizes - Copper, Brass, Pewter, Silver -- Self-Stirring -- Collapsible, said a sign hanging over them.  \\\\\\\"Yeah, you'll be needin' one,\\\\\\\" said Hagrid, \\\\\\\"but we gotta get yer money first.\\\\\\\"  Harry wished he had about eight more eyes. He turned his head in every direction as they walked up the street, trying to look at everything at once: the shops, the things outside them, the people doing their shopping. A plump woman outside an Apothecary was shaking her head as they passed, saying, \\\\\\\"Dragon liver, seventeen Sickles an ounce, they're mad....\\\\\\\"  A low, soft hooting came from a dark shop with a sign saying Eeylops Owl Emporium -- Tawny, Screech, Barn, Brown, and Snowy. Several boys of about Harry's age had their noses pressed against a window with broomsticks in it. \\\\\\\"Look,\\\\\\\" Harry heard one of them say, \\\\\\\"the new Nimbus Two Thousand -- fastest ever --\\\\\\\" There were shops selling robes, shops selling telescopes and strange silver instruments Harry had never seen before, windows stacked with barrels of bat spleens and eels' eyes, tottering piles of spell books, quills, and rolls of parchment, potion bottles, globes of the moon....  \\\\\\\"Gringotts,\\\\\\\" said Hagrid.  They had reached a snowy white building that towered over the other little shops. Standing beside its burnished bronze doors, wearing a uniform of scarlet and gold, was -  \\\\\\\"Yeah, that's a goblin,\\\\\\\" said Hagrid quietly as they walked up the white stone steps toward him. The goblin was about a head shorter than Harry. He had a swarthy, clever face, a pointed beard and, Harry noticed, very long fingers and feet. He bowed as they walked inside. Now they were facing a second pair of doors, silver this time, with words engraved upon them:  Enter, stranger, but take heed  Of what awaits the sin of greed,  For those who take, but do not earn,  Must pay most dearly in their turn.  So if you seek beneath our floors  A treasure that was never yours,  Thief, you have been warned, beware  Of finding more than treasure there.  \\\\\\\"Like I said, Yeh'd be mad ter try an' rob it,\\\\\\\" said Hagrid.  A pair of goblins bowed them through the silver doors and they were in a vast marble hall. About a hundred more goblins were sitting on high stools behind a long counter, scribbling in large ledgers, weighing coins in brass scales, examining precious stones through eyeglasses. There were too many doors to count leading off the hall, and yet more goblins were showing people in and out of these. Hagrid and Harry made for the counter.  \\\\\\\"Morning,\\\\\\\" said Hagrid to a free goblin. \\\\\\\"We've come ter take some money outta Mr. Harry Potter's safe.\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"You have his key, Sir?\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"Got it here somewhere,\\\\\\\" said Hagrid, and he started emptying his pockets onto the counter, scattering a handful of moldy dog biscuits over the goblin's book of numbers. The goblin wrinkled his nose. Harry watched the goblin on their right weighing a pile of rubies as big as glowing coals.  \\\\\\\"Got it,\\\\\\\" said Hagrid at last, holding up a tiny golden key.  The goblin looked at it closely.  \\\\\\\"That seems to be in order.\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"An' I've also got a letter here from Professor Dumbledore,\\\\\\\" said Hagrid importantly, throwing out his chest. \\\\\\\"It's about the YouKnow-What in vault seven hundred and thirteen.\\\\\\\"  The goblin read the letter carefully.  \\\\\\\"Very well,\\\\\\\" he said, handing it back to Hagrid, \\\\\\\"I will have Someone take you down to both vaults. Griphook!\\\\\\\"  Griphook was yet another goblin. Once Hagrid had crammed all the dog biscuits back inside his pockets, he and Harry followed Griphook toward one of the doors leading off the hall.  \\\\\\\"What's the You-Know-What in vault seven hundred and thirteen?\\\\\\\" Harry asked.  \\\\\\\"Can't tell yeh that,\\\\\\\" said Hagrid mysteriously. \\\\\\\"Very secret. Hogwarts business. Dumbledore's trusted me. More'n my job's worth ter tell yeh that.\\\\\\\"  Griphook held the door open for them. Harry, who had expected more marble, was surprised. They were in a narrow stone passageway lit with flaming torches. It sloped steeply downward and there were little railway tracks on the floor. Griphook whistled and a small cart came hurtling up the tracks toward them. They climbed in -- Hagrid with some difficulty -- and were off.  At first they just hurtled through a maze of twisting passages. Harry tried to remember, left, right, right, left, middle fork, right, left, but it was impossible. The rattling cart seemed to know its own way, because Griphook wasn't steering.  Harry's eyes stung as the cold air rushed past them, but he kept them wide open. Once, he thought he saw a burst of fire at the end of a passage and twisted around to see if it was a dragon, but too late - - they plunged even deeper, passing an underground lake where huge stalactites and stalagmites grew from the ceiling and floor.  I never know,\\\\\\\" Harry called to Hagrid over the noise of the cart, \\\\\\\"what's the difference between a stalagmite and a stalactite?\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"Stalagmite's got an 'm' in it,\\\\\\\" said Hagrid. \\\\\\\"An' don' ask me questions just now, I think I'm gonna be sick.\\\\\\\"  He did look very green, and when the cart stopped at last beside a small door in the passage wall, Hagrid got out and had to lean against the wall to stop his knees from trembling.  Griphook unlocked the door. A lot of green smoke came billowing out, and as it cleared, Harry gasped. Inside were mounds of gold coins. Columns of silver. Heaps of little bronze Knuts.  \\\\\\\"All yours,\\\\\\\" smiled Hagrid.  All Harry's -- it was incredible. The Dursleys couldn't have known about this or they'd have had it from him faster than blinking. How often had they complained how much Harry cost them to keep? And all the time there had been a small fortune belonging to him, buried deep under London.  Hagrid helped Harry pile some of it into a bag.  \\\\\\\"The gold ones are Galleons,\\\\\\\" he explained. \\\\\\\"Seventeen silver Sickles to a Galleon and twenty-nine Knuts to a Sickle, it's easy enough. Right, that should be enough fer a couple o' terms, we'll keep the rest safe for yeh.\\\\\\\" He turned to Griphook. \\\\\\\"Vault seven hundred and thirteen now, please, and can we go more slowly?\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"One speed only,\\\\\\\" said Griphook.  They were going even deeper now and gathering speed. The air became colder and colder as they hurtled round tight corners. They went rattling over an underground ravine, and Harry leaned over the side to try to see what was down at the dark bottom, but Hagrid groaned and pulled him back by the scruff of his neck.  Vault seven hundred and thirteen had no keyhole.  \\\\\\\"Stand back,\\\\\\\" said Griphook importantly. He stroked the door gently with one of his long fingers and it simply melted away.  \\\\\\\"If anyone but a Gringotts goblin tried that, they'd be sucked through the door and trapped in there,\\\\\\\" said Griphook.  \\\\\\\"How often do you check to see if anyone's inside?\\\\\\\" Harry asked.  \\\\\\\"About once every ten years,\\\\\\\" said Griphook with a rather nasty grin.  Something really extraordinary had to be inside this top security vault, Harry was sure, and he leaned forward eagerly, expecting to see fabulous jewels at the very least -- but at first he thought it was empty. Then he noticed a grubby little package wrapped up in brown paper lying on the floor. Hagrid picked it up and tucked it deep inside his coat. Harry longed to know what it was, but knew better than to ask.  \\\\\\\"Come on, back in this infernal cart, and don't talk to me on the way back, it's best if I keep me mouth shut,\\\\\\\" said Hagrid.  One wild cart ride later they stood blinking in the sunlight outside Gringotts. Harry didn't know where to run first now that he had a bag full of money. He didn't have to know how many Galleons there were to a pound to know that he was holding more money than he'd had in his whole life -- more money than even Dudley had ever had.  \\\\\\\"Might as well get yer uniform,\\\\\\\" said Hagrid, nodding toward Madam Malkin's Robes for All Occasions. \\\\\\\"Listen, Harry, would yeh mind if I slipped off fer a pick-me-up in the Leaky Cauldron? I hate them Gringotts carts.\\\\\\\" He did still look a bit sick, so Harry entered Madam Malkin's shop alone, feeling nervous.  Madam Malkin was a squat, smiling witch dressed all in mauve.  \\\\\\\"Hogwarts, clear?\\\\\\\" she said, when Harry started to speak. \\\\\\\"Got the lot here -- another young man being fitted up just now, in fact. \\\\\\\"  In the back of the shop, a boy with a pale, pointed face was standing on a footstool while a second witch pinned up his long black robes. Madam Malkin stood Harry on a stool next to him) slipped a long robe over his head, and began to pin it to the right length.  \\\\\\\"Hello,\\\\\\\" said the boy, \\\\\\\"Hogwarts, too?\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"Yes,\\\\\\\" said Harry.  \\\\\\\"My father's next door buying my books and mother's up the street looking at wands,\\\\\\\" said the boy. He had a bored, drawling voice. \\\\\\\"Then I'm going to drag them off to took at racing brooms. I don't see why first years can't have their own. I think I'll bully father into getting me one and I'll smuggle it in somehow.\\\\\\\"  Harry was strongly reminded of Dudley.  \\\\\\\"Have you got your own broom?\\\\\\\" the boy went on.  \\\\\\\"No,\\\\\\\" said Harry.  \\\\\\\"Play Quidditch at all?\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"No,\\\\\\\" Harry said again, wondering what on earth Quidditch could be.  \\\\\\\"I do -- Father says it's a crime if I'm not picked to play for my house, and I must say, I agree. Know what house you'll be in yet?\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"No,\\\\\\\" said Harry, feeling more stupid by the minute.  \\\\\\\"Well, no one really knows until they get there, do they, but I know I'll be in Slytherin, all our family have been -- imagine being in Hufflepuff, I think I'd leave, wouldn't you?\\\\\\\" \\\\\\\"Mmm,\\\\\\\" said Harry, wishing he could say something a bit more interesting.  \\\\\\\"I say, look at that man!\\\\\\\" said the boy suddenly, nodding toward the front window. Hagrid was standing there, grinning at Harry and pointing at two large ice creams to show he couldn't come in.  \\\\\\\"That's Hagrid,\\\\\\\" said Harry, pleased to know something the boy didn't. \\\\\\\"He works at Hogwarts.\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"Oh,\\\\\\\" said the boy, \\\\\\\"I've heard of him. He's a sort of servant, isn't he?\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"He's the gamekeeper,\\\\\\\" said Harry. He was liking the boy less and less every second.  \\\\\\\"Yes, exactly. I heard he's a sort of savage -- lives in a hut on the school grounds and every now and then he gets drunk, tries to do magic, and ends up setting fire to his bed.\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"I think he's brilliant,\\\\\\\" said Harry coldly.  \\\\\\\"Do you?\\\\\\\" said the boy, with a slight sneer. \\\\\\\"Why is he with you? Where are your parents?\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"They're dead,\\\\\\\" said Harry shortly. He didn't feel much like going into the matter with this boy.  \\\\\\\"Oh, sorry,\\\\\\\" said the other,. not sounding sorry at all. \\\\\\\"But they were our kind, weren't they?\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"They were a witch and wizard, if that's what you mean.\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"I really don't think they should let the other sort in, do you? They're just not the same, they've never been brought up to know our ways. Some of them have never even heard of Hogwarts until they get the letter, imagine. I think they should keep it in the old wizarding families. What's your surname, anyway?\\\\\\\"  But before Harry could answer, Madam Malkin said, \\\\\\\"That's you done, my dear,\\\\\\\" and Harry, not sorry for an excuse to stop talking to the boy, hopped down from the footstool.  \\\\\\\"Well, I'll see you at Hogwarts, I suppose,\\\\\\\" said the drawling boy.  Harry was rather quiet as he ate the ice cream Hagrid had bought him (chocolate and raspberry with chopped nuts).  \\\\\\\"What's up?\\\\\\\" said Hagrid.  \\\\\\\"Nothing,\\\\\\\" Harry lied. They stopped to buy parchment and quills. Harry cheered up a bit when he found a bottle of ink that changed color as you wrote. When they had left the shop, he said, \\\\\\\"Hagrid, what's Quidditch?\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"Blimey, Harry, I keep forgettin' how little yeh know -- not knowin' about Quidditch!\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"Don't make me feel worse,\\\\\\\" said Harry. He told Hagrid about the pate boy in Madam Malkin's.  \\\\\\\"--and he said people from Muggle families shouldn't even be allowed in.\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"Yer not from a Muggle family. If he'd known who yeh were -- he's grown up knowin' yer name if his parents are wizardin' folk. You saw what everyone in the Leaky Cauldron was like when they saw yeh. Anyway, what does he know about it, some o' the best I ever saw were the only ones with magic in 'em in a long line 0' Muggles -- look at yer mum! Look what she had fer a sister!\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"So what is Quidditch?\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"It's our sport. Wizard sport. It's like -- like soccer in the Muggle world -- everyone follows Quidditch -- played up in the air on broomsticks and there's four balls -- sorta hard ter explain the rules.\\\\\\\" \\\\\\\"And what are Slytherin and Hufflepuff?\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"School houses. There's four. Everyone says Hufflepuff are a lot o' duffers, but --\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"I bet I'm in Hufflepuff\\\\\\\" said Harry gloomily.  \\\\\\\"Better Hufflepuff than Slytherin,\\\\\\\" said Hagrid darkly. \\\\\\\"There's not a single witch or wizard who went bad who wasn't in Slytherin. You-Know-Who was one.\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"Vol-, sorry - You-Know-Who was at Hogwarts?\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"Years an' years ago,\\\\\\\" said Hagrid.  They bought Harry's school books in a shop called Flourish and Blotts where the shelves were stacked to the ceiling with books as large as paving stones bound in leather; books the size of postage stamps in covers of silk; books full of peculiar symbols and a few books with nothing in them at all. Even Dudley, who never read anything, would have been wild to get his hands on some of these. Hagrid almost had to drag Harry away from Curses and Countercurses (Bewitch Your Friends and Befuddle Your Enemies with the Latest Revenges: Hair Loss, Jelly-Legs, Tongue- Tying and Much, Much More) by Professor Vindictus Viridian.  \\\\\\\"I was trying to find out how to curse Dudley.\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"I'm not sayin' that's not a good idea, but yer not ter use magic in the Muggle world except in very special circumstances,\\\\\\\" said Hagrid. \\\\\\\"An' anyway, yeh couldn' work any of them curses yet, yeh'll need a lot more study before yeh get ter that level.\\\\\\\"  Hagrid wouldn't let Harry buy a solid gold cauldron, either (\\\\\\\"It says pewter on yer list\\\\\\\"), but they got a nice set of scales for weighing potion ingredients and a collapsible brass telescope. Then they visited the Apothecary, which was fascinating enough to make up for its horrible smell, a mixture of bad eggs and rotted cabbages. Barrels of slimy stuff stood on the floor; jars of herbs, dried roots, and bright powders lined the walls; bundles of feathers, strings of fangs, and snarled claws hung from the ceiling. While Hagrid asked the man behind the counter for a supply of some basic potion ingredients for Harry, Harry himself examined silver unicorn horns at twenty-one Galleons each and minuscule, glittery-black beetle eyes (five Knuts a scoop).  Outside the Apothecary, Hagrid checked Harry's list again.  \\\\\\\"Just yer wand left - A yeah, an' I still haven't got yeh a birthday present.\\\\\\\"  Harry felt himself go red.  \\\\\\\"You don't have to --\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"I know I don't have to. Tell yeh what, I'll get yer animal. Not a toad, toads went outta fashion years ago, yeh'd be laughed at - an' I don' like cats, they make me sneeze. I'll get yer an owl. All the kids want owls, they're dead useful, carry yer mail an' everythin'.\\\\\\\"  Twenty minutes later, they left Eeylops Owl Emporium, which had been dark and full of rustling and flickering, jewel-bright eyes. Harry now carried a large cage that held a beautiful snowy owl, fast asleep with her head under her wing. He couldn't stop stammering his thanks, sounding just like Professor Quirrell.  \\\\\\\"Don' mention it,\\\\\\\" said Hagrid gruffly. \\\\\\\"Don' expect you've had a lotta presents from them Dursleys. Just Ollivanders left now - only place fer wands, Ollivanders, and yeh gotta have the best wand.\\\\\\\"  A magic wand... this was what Harry had been really looking forward to.  The last shop was narrow and shabby. Peeling gold letters over the door read Ollivanders: Makers of Fine Wands since 382 B.C. A single wand lay on a faded purple cushion in the dusty window.  A tinkling bell rang somewhere in the depths of the shop as they stepped inside. It was a tiny place, empty except for a single, spindly chair that Hagrid sat on to wait. Harry felt strangely as though he had entered a very strict library; he swallowed a lot of new questions that had just occurred to him and looked instead at the thousands of narrow boxes piled neatly right up to the ceiling. For some reason, the back of his neck prickled. The very dust and silence in here seemed to tingle with some secret magic.  \\\\\\\"Good afternoon,\\\\\\\" said a soft voice. Harry jumped. Hagrid must have jumped, too, because there was a loud crunching noise and he got quickly off the spindly chair.  An old man was standing before them, his wide, pale eyes shining like moons through the gloom of the shop.  \\\\\\\"Hello,\\\\\\\" said Harry awkwardly.  \\\\\\\"Ah yes,\\\\\\\" said the man. \\\\\\\"Yes, yes. I thought I'd be seeing you soon. Harry Potter.\\\\\\\" It wasn't a question. \\\\\\\"You have your mother's eyes. It seems only yesterday she was in here herself, buying her first wand. Ten and a quarter inches long, swishy, made of willow. Nice wand for charm work.\\\\\\\"  Mr. Ollivander moved closer to Harry. Harry wished he would blink. Those silvery eyes were a bit creepy.  \\\\\\\"Your father, on the other hand, favored a mahogany wand. Eleven inches. Pliable. A little more power and excellent for transfiguration. Well, I say your father favored it -- it's really the wand that chooses the wizard, of course.\\\\\\\"  Mr. Ollivander had come so close that he and Harry were almost nose to nose. Harry could see himself reflected in those misty eyes.  \\\\\\\"And that's where...\\\\\\\"  Mr. Ollivander touched the lightning scar on Harry's forehead with a long, white finger.  \\\\\\\"I'm sorry to say I sold the wand that did it,\\\\\\\" he said softly. \\\\\\\"Thirteen-and-a-half inches. Yew. Powerful wand, very powerful, and in the wrong hands... well, if I'd known what that wand was going out into the world to do....\\\\\\\"  He shook his head and then, to Harry's relief, spotted Hagrid.  \\\\\\\"Rubeus! Rubeus Hagrid! How nice to see you again.... Oak, sixteen inches, rather bendy, wasn't it?\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"It was, sir, yes,\\\\\\\" said Hagrid.  \\\\\\\"Good wand, that one. But I suppose they snapped it in half when you got expelled?\\\\\\\" said Mr. Ollivander, suddenly stern.  \\\\\\\"Er -- yes, they did, yes,\\\\\\\" said Hagrid, shuffling his feet. \\\\\\\"I've still got the pieces, though,\\\\\\\" he added brightly.  \\\\\\\"But you don't use them?\\\\\\\" said Mr. Ollivander sharply.  \\\\\\\"Oh, no, sit,\\\\\\\" said Hagrid quickly. Harry noticed he gripped his pink umbrella very tightly as he spoke.  \\\\\\\"Hmmm,\\\\\\\" said Mr. Ollivander, giving Hagrid a piercing look. \\\\\\\"Well, now -- Mr. Potter. Let me see.\\\\\\\" He pulled a long tape measure with silver markings out of his pocket. \\\\\\\"Which is your wand arm?\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"Er -- well, I'm right-handed,\\\\\\\" said Harry.  \\\\\\\"Hold out your arm. That's it.\\\\\\\" He measured Harry from shoulder to finger, then wrist to elbow, shoulder to floor, knee to armpit and round his head. As he measured, he said, \\\\\\\"Every Ollivander wand has a core of a powerful magical substance, Mr. Potter. We use unicorn hairs, phoenix tail feathers, and the heartstrings of dragons. No two Ollivander wands are the same, just as no two unicorns, dragons, or phoenixes are quite the same. And of course, you will never get such good results with another wizard's wand.\\\\\\\"  Harry suddenly realized that the tape measure, which was measuring between his nostrils, was doing this on its own. Mr. Ollivander was flitting around the shelves, taking down boxes.  \\\\\\\"That will do,\\\\\\\" he said, and the tape measure crumpled into a heap on the floor. \\\\\\\"Right then, Mr. Potter. Try this one. Beechwood and dragon heartstring. Nine inches. Nice and flexible. just take it and give it a wave.\\\\\\\"  Harry took the wand and (feeling foolish) waved it around a bit, but Mr. Ollivander snatched it out of his hand almost at once.  \\\\\\\"Maple and phoenix feather. Seven inches. Quite whippy. Try --\\\\\\\"  Harry tried -- but he had hardly raised the wand when it, too, was snatched back by Mr. Ollivander.  \\\\\\\"No, no -here, ebony and unicorn hair, eight and a half inches, springy. Go on, go on, try it out.\\\\\\\"  Harry tried. And tried. He had no idea what Mr. Ollivander was waiting for. The pile of tried wands was mounting higher and higher on the spindly chair, but the more wands Mr. Ollivander pulled from the shelves, the happier he seemed to become.  \\\\\\\"Tricky customer, eh? Not to worry, we'll find the perfect match here somewhere -- I wonder, now - - yes, why not -- unusual combination -- holly and phoenix feather, eleven inches, nice and supple.\\\\\\\"  Harry took the wand. He felt a sudden warmth in his fingers. He raised the wand above his head, brought it swishing down through the dusty air and a stream of red and gold sparks shot from the end like a firework, throwing dancing spots of light on to the walls. Hagrid whooped and clapped and Mr. Ollivander cried, \\\\\\\"Oh, bravo! Yes, indeed, oh, very good. Well, well, well... how curious... how very curious... \\\\\\\"  He put Harry's wand back into its box and wrapped it in brown paper, still muttering, \\\\\\\"Curious... curious..  \\\\\\\"Sorry,\\\\\\\" said Harry, \\\\\\\"but what's curious?\\\\\\\"  Mr. Ollivander fixed Harry with his pale stare.  \\\\\\\"I remember every wand I've ever sold, Mr. Potter. Every single wand. It so happens that the phoenix whose tail feather is in your wand, gave another feather -- just one other. It is very curious indeed that you should be destined for this wand when its brother why, its brother gave you that scar.\\\\\\\"  Harry swallowed.  \\\\\\\"Yes, thirteen-and-a-half inches. Yew. Curious indeed how these things happen. The wand chooses the wizard, remember.... I think we must expect great things from you, Mr. Potter.... After all, He- Who-Must-Not-Be-Named did great things -- terrible, yes, but great.\\\\\\\"  Harry shivered. He wasn't sure he liked Mr. Ollivander too much. He paid seven gold Galleons for his wand, and Mr. Ollivander bowed them from his shop.  The late afternoon sun hung low in the sky as Harry and Hagrid made their way back down Diagon Alley, back through the wall, back through the Leaky Cauldron, now empty. Harry didn't speak at all as they walked down the road; he didn't even notice how much people were gawking at them on the Underground, laden as they were with all their funny-shaped packages, with the snowy owl asleep in its cage on Harry's lap. Up another escalator, out into Paddington station; Harry only realized where they were when Hagrid tapped him on the shoulder.  \\\\\\\"Got time fer a bite to eat before yer train leaves,\\\\\\\" he said.  He bought Harry a hamburger and they sat down on plastic seats to eat them. Harry kept looking around. Everything looked so strange, somehow.  \\\\\\\"You all right, Harry? Yer very quiet,\\\\\\\" said Hagrid.  Harry wasn't sure he could explain. He'd just had the best birthday of his life -- and yet -- he chewed his hamburger, trying to find the words.  \\\\\\\"Everyone thinks I'm special,\\\\\\\" he said at last. \\\\\\\"All those people in the Leaky Cauldron, Professor Quirrell, Mr. Ollivander... but I don't know anything about magic at all. How can they expect great things? I'm famous and I can't even remember what I'm famous for. I don't know what happened when Vol-, sorry -- I mean, the night my parents died.\\\\\\\"  Hagrid leaned across the table. Behind the wild beard and eyebrows he wore a very kind smile.  \\\\\\\"Don' you worry, Harry. You'll learn fast enough. Everyone starts at the beginning at Hogwarts, you'll be just fine. just be yerself. I know it's hard. Yeh've been singled out, an' that's always hard. But yeh'll have a great time at Hogwarts -- I did -- still do, 'smatter of fact.\\\\\\\"  Hagrid helped Harry on to the train that would take him back to the Dursleys, then handed him an envelope.  \\\\\\\"Yer ticket fer Hogwarts, \\\\\\\" he said. \\\\\\\"First o' September -- King's Cross -- it's all on yer ticket. Any problems with the Dursleys, send me a letter with yer owl, she'll know where to find me.... See yeh soon, Harry.\\\\\\\"  The train pulled out of the station. Harry wanted to watch Hagrid until he was out of sight; he rose in his seat and pressed his nose against the window, but he blinked and Hagrid had gone.  \\\"\",\n          \"  \\\\What d'you mean, I won't be -?\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"I've waited a long time for this, Harry Potter,\\\\\\\" said Riddle. \\\\\\\"For the chance to see you. To speak to you.\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"Look,\\\\\\\" said Harry, losing patience, \\\\\\\"I don't think you get it. We're in the Chamber of Secrets. We can talk later -\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"We're going to talk now,\\\\\\\" said Riddle, still smiling broadly, and he pocketed Harry's wand.  Harry stared at him. There was something very funny going on here ....  \\\\\\\"How did Ginny get like this?\\\\\\\" he asked slowly.  \\\\\\\"Well, that's an interesting question,\\\\\\\" said Riddle pleasantly. \\\\\\\"And quite a long story. I suppose the real reason Ginny Weasley's like this is because she opened her heart and spilled all her secrets to an invisible stranger.\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"What are you talking about?\\\\\\\" said Harry.  \\\\\\\"The diary,\\\\\\\" said Riddle. `My diary. Little Ginny's been writing in it for months and months, telling me all her pitiful worries and woes - how her brothers tease her, how she had to come to school with secondhand robes and books, how\\\\\\\" -Riddle's eyes glinted \\\\\\\"how she didn't think famous, good, great Harry Potter would ever like her . . . .\\\\\\\"  All the time he spoke, Riddle's eyes never left Harry's face. There was an almost hungry look in them.  \\\\\\\"It's very boring, having to listen to the silly little troubles of an eleven- year-old girl,\\\\\\\" he went on. \\\\\\\"But I was patient. I wrote back. I was sympathetic, I was kind. Ginny simply loved me. No one's ever understood me like you, Tom .... I'm so glad I've got this diary to  *309*  confide in .... It's like having a friend I can carry around in my pocket . . . .  Riddle laughed, a high, cold laugh that didn't suit him. It made the hairs stand up on the back of Harry's neck.  \\\\\\\"If I say it myself, Harry, I've always been able to charm the people I needed. So Ginny poured out her soul to me, and her soul happened to be exactly what I wanted .... I grew stronger and stronger on a diet of her deepest fears, her darkest secrets. I grew powerful, far more powerful than little Miss Weasley. Powerful enough to start feeding Miss Weasley a few of my secrets, to start pouring a little of my soul back into her. . .\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"What d'you mean?\\\\\\\" said Harry, whose mouth had gone very dry.  \\\\\\\" Haven't you guessed yet, Harry Potter?\\\\\\\" said Riddle softly. \\\\\\\"Ginny Weasley opened the Chamber of Secrets. She strangled the school roosters and daubed threatening messages on the walls. She set the Serpent of Slytherin on four Mudbloods, and the Squib's cat.  \\\\\\\"No,\\\\\\\" Harry whispered.  \\\\\\\"Yes,\\\\\\\" said Riddle, calmly. \\\\\\\"Of course, she didn't know what she was doing at first. It was very amusing. I wish you could have seen her new diary entries ... far more interesting, they became .... Dear Tom,\\\\\\\" he recited, watching Harry's horrified face, `I think I'm losing my memory. There are rooster feathers all over my robes and 1 don't know how they got there. Dear Tom, l can't remember what 1 did on the night of Halloween, but a cat was attacked and I've got paint all down my front. Dear Tom, Percy keeps telling me I'm pale and I'm not myself. I think he suspects me... There was another attack today\\u00a0and I don't know where I was. Tom, what am I going to do? I think I'm going mad... I think I'm the one attacking everyone, Tom!\\\\\\\"  Harry's fists were clenched, the nails digging deep into his Palms.  \\\\\\\"it took a very long time for stupid little Ginny to stop trusting her diary,\\\\\\\" said Riddle. \\\\\\\"But she finally became suspicious and tried to dispose of it. And that's where you came in, Harry. You found it, and I couldn't have been more delighted. Of all the people who could have picked it up, it was you, the very person I was most anxious to meet . . . .\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"And why did you want to meet me?\\\\\\\" said Harry. Anger was coursing through him, and it was an effort to keep his voice steady.  \\\\\\\"Well, you see, Ginny told me all about you, Harry,\\\\\\\" said Riddle. \\\\\\\"Your whole fascinating history. \\\\\\\" His eyes roved over the lightning scar on Harry's forehead, and their expression grew hungrier. \\\\\\\"I knew I must find out more about you, talk to you, meet you if I could. So I decided to show you my famous capture of that great oaf, Hagrid, to gain your trust -\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"Hagrid's my friend,\\\\\\\" said Harry, his voice now shaking. \\\\\\\"And you framed him, didn't you? I thought you made a mistake, but -\\\\\\\"  Riddle laughed his high laugh again.  \\\\\\\"It was my word against Hagrid's, Harry. Well, you can imagine how it looked to old Armando Dippet. On the one hand, Tom Riddle, poor but brilliant, parentless but so brave, school prefect, model student ... on the other hand, big, blundering Hagrid, in trouble every other week, trying to raise werewolf cubs under his bed, sneaking off to the Forbidden Forest to wrestle trolls ... but I\\u00a0admit, even I was surprised how well the plan worked. I thought someone must realize that Hagrid couldn't possibly be the Heir of Slytherin. It had taken me five whole years to find out everything I could about the Chamber of Secrets and discover the secret entrance ... as though Hagrid had the brains, or the power!  \\\\\\\"Only the Transfiguration teacher, Dumbledore, seemed to think Hagrid was innocent. He persuaded Dipper to keep Hagrid and train him as gamekeeper. Yes, I think Dumbledore might have guessed .... Dumbledore never seemed to like me as much as the other teachers did ......  \\\\\\\"I bet Dumbledore saw right through you,\\\\\\\" said Harry, his teeth gritted.  \\\\\\\"Well, he certainly kept an annoyingly close watch on me after Hagrid was expelled,\\\\\\\" said Riddle carelessly. \\\\\\\"I knew it wouldn't be safe to open the Chamber again while I was still at school. But I wasn't going to waste those long years Id spent searching for it. I decided to leave behind a diary, preserving my sixteen-year-old self in its pages, so that one day, with luck, I would be able to lead another in my footsteps, and finish Salazar Slytherin's noble work.\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"Well, you haven't finished it,\\\\\\\" said Harry triumphantly. \\\\\\\"No one's died this time, not even the cat. In a few hours the Mandrake Draught will be ready and everyone who was Petrified will be all right again -\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"Haven't I already told you,\\\\\\\" said Riddle quietly, \\\\\\\"that killing Mudbloods doesn't matter to me anymore? For many months now, my new target has been -you.\\\\\\\"  Harry stared at him.  \\\\\\\"Imagine how angry I was when the next time my diary was\\u00a0opened, it was Ginny who was writing to me, not you. She saw you with the diary, you see, and panicked. \\\\\\\"What if you found out how to work it, and I repeated all her secrets to you? What if, even worse, I told you who'd been strangling roosters? So the foolish little brat waited until your dormitory was deserted and stole it back. But I knew what I must do. It was clear to me that you were on the trail of Slytherin's heir. From everything Ginny had told me about you, I knew you would go to any lengths to solve the mystery --  particularly if one of your best friends was attacked. And Ginny had told me the whole school was buzzing because you could speak Parseltongue ....  \\\\\\\"So I made Ginny write her own farewell on the wall and come down here to wait. She struggled and cried and became very boring. But there isn't much life left in her .... She put too much into the diary, into me. Enough to let me leave its pages at last .... I have been waiting for you to appear since we arrived here. I knew you'd come. I have many questions for you, Harry Potter.\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"Like what?\\\\\\\" Harry spat, fists still clenched.  \\\\\\\"Well,\\\\\\\" said Riddle, smiling pleasantly, \\\\\\\"how is it that you a skinny boy with no extraordinary magical talent - managed to defeat the greatest wizard of all time? How did you escape with nothing but a scar, while Lord Voldemort's powers were destroyed?\\\\\\\"  There was an odd red gleam in his hungry eyes now.  \\\\\\\"Why do you care how I escaped?\\\\\\\" said Harry slowly. \\\\\\\"Voldemort was after your time ......  \\\\\\\"Voldemort,\\\\\\\" said Riddle softly, \\\\\\\"is my past, present, and future, Harry Potter . . . .\\\\\\\"  He pulled Harry's wand from his pocket and began to trace it through the air, writing three shimmering words:  TOM MARVOLO RIDDLE  Then he waved the wand once, and the letters of his name rearranged themselves:  I AM LORD VOLDEMORT  \\\\\\\"You see?\\\\\\\" he whispered. \\\\\\\"It was a name I was already using at Hogwarts, to my most intimate friends only, of course. You think I was going to use my filthy Muggle father's name forever? I, in whose veins runs the blood of Salazar Slytherin himself, through my mother's side? I, keep the name of a foul, common Muggle, who abandoned me even before I was born, just because he found out his wife was a witch? No, Harry - I fashioned myself a new name, a name I knew wizards everywhere would one day fear to speak, when I had become the greatest sorcerer in the world!\\\\\\\"  Harry's brain seemed to have jammed. He stared numbly at Riddle, at the orphaned boy who had grown up to murder Harry's own parents, and so many others .... At last he forced himself to -,peak.  \\\\\\\"You're not,\\\\\\\" he said, his quiet voice full of hatred.  \\\\\\\"Not what?\\\\\\\" snapped Riddle.  \\\\\\\"Not the greatest sorcerer in the world,\\\\\\\" said Harry, breathing fast. \\\\\\\"Sorry to disappoint you and all that, but the greatest wizard in the world is Albus Dumbledore. Everyone says so. Even when you were strong, you didn't dare try and take over at Hogwarts. Dumbledore saw through you when you were at school and he still frightens you now, wherever you're hiding these days -\\\\\\\"  The smile had gone from Riddle's face, to be replaced by a very ugly look.\\u00a0  \\\\\\\"Dumbledore's been driven out of this castle by the mere memory of me!\\\\\\\" he hissed.  \\\\\\\"He's not as gone as you might think!\\\\\\\" Harry retorted. He was speaking at random, wanting to scare Riddle, wishing rather than believing it to be true  Riddle opened his mouth, but froze.  Music was coming from somewhere. Riddle whirled around to stare down the empty Chamber. The music was growing louder. It was eerie, spine-tingling, unearthly; it lifted the hair on Harry's scalp and made his heart feel as though it was swelling to twice its normal size. Then, as the music reached such a pitch that Harry felt it vibrating inside his own ribs, flames erupted at the top of the nearest pillar.  A crimson bird the size of a swan had appeared, piping its weird music to the vaulted ceiling. It had a glittering golden tail as long as a peacock's and gleaming golden talons, which were gripping a ragged bundle.  A second later, the bird was flying straight at Harry. It dropped the ragged thing it was carrying at his feet, then landed heavily on his shoulder. As it folded its great wings, Harry looked up and saw it had a long, sharp golden beak and a beady black eye.  The bird stopped singing. It sat still and warm next to Harry's cheek, gazing steadily at Riddle.  \\\\\\\"That's a phoenix\\tsaid Riddle, staring shrewdly back at it.  \\\\\\\"Fawkes?\\\\\\\" Harry breathed, and he felt the bird's golden claws squeeze his shoulder gently  \\\\\\\"And that -\\\\\\\" said Riddle, now eyeing the ragged thing that Fawkes had dropped, \\\\\\\"that's the old school Sorting Hat -\\\\\\\"  So it was. Patched, frayed, and dirty, the hat lay motionless at Harry's feet.  Riddle began to laugh again. He laughed so hard that the dark chamber rang with it, as though ten Riddles were laughing at once  \\\\\\\"This is what Dumbledore sends his defender! A songbird and an old hat! Do you feel brave, Harry Potter? Do you feel safe now?\\\\\\\"  Harry didn't answer. He might not see what use Fawkes or the Sorting Hat were, but he was no longer alone, and he waited for Riddle to stop laughing with his courage mounting.  \\\\\\\"To business, Harry,\\\\\\\" said Riddle, still smiling broadly. \\\\\\\"Twice - in your past, in my future - we have met. And twice I failed to kill you. How did you survive? Tell me everything. The longer you talk,\\\\\\\" he added softly, \\\\\\\"the longer you stay alive.\\\\\\\"  Harry was thinking fast, weighing his chances. Riddle had the wand. He, Harry, had Fawkes and the Sorting Hat, neither of which would be much good in a duel. It looked bad, all right ... but the longer Riddle stood there, the more life was dwindling out of Ginny ... and in the meantime, Harry noticed suddenly, Riddle's outline was becoming clearer, more solid .... If it had to be a fight between him and Riddle, better sooner than later.  \\\\\\\"No one knows why you lost your powers when you attacked me,\\\\\\\" said Harry abruptly. \\\\\\\"I don't know myself But I know why you couldn't kill me. Because my mother died to save me. My common Muggle-born mother,\\\\\\\" he added, shaking with suppressed rage. \\\\\\\"She stopped you killing me. And I've seen the real you, I saw you last year. You're a wreck. You're barely alive. That's where all your power got you. You're in hiding. You're ugly, you're foul -\\\\\\\"\\u00a0  Riddle's face contorted. Then he forced it into an awful smile. \\\\\\\"So. Your mother died to save you. Yes, that's a powerful countercharm. I can see now ... there is nothing special about you, after all. I wondered, you see. There are strange likenesses between us, after all. Even you must have noticed. Both half-bloods, orphans, raised by Muggles. Probably the only two Parselmouths to come to Hogwarts since the great Slytherin himself We even look something alike ... but after all, it was merely a lucky chance that saved you from me. That's all I wanted to know.\\\\\\\"  Harry stood, tense, waiting for Riddle to raise his wand. But Riddle's twisted smile was widening again.  \\\\\\\"Now, Harry, I'm going to teach you a little lesson. Let's match the powers of Lord Voldemort, Heir of Salazar Slytherin, against famous Harry Potter, and the best weapons Dumbledore can give him . . . .\\\\\\\"  He cast an amused eye over Fawkes and the Sorting Hat, then walked away. Harry, fear spreading up his numb legs, watched Ridthe stop between the high pillars and look up into the stone face of Slytherin, high above him in the half-darkness. Riddle opened his mouth wide and hissed - but Harry understood what he was saying ....  \\\\\\\"Speak to me, Slytherin, greatest of the Hogwarts Four. \\\\\\\"  Harry wheeled around to look up at the statue, Fawkes swaying on his shoulder.  Slytherin's gigantic stone face was moving. Horrorstruck, Harry saw his mouth opening, wider and wider, to make a huge black hole.  And something was stirring inside the statue's mouth. Something was slithering up from its depths. 3 1  Harry backed away until he hit the dark Chamber wall, and as he shut his eyes tight he felt Fawkes' wing sweep his cheek as he took flight. Harry wanted to shout, \\\\\\\"Don't leave me!\\\\\\\" but what chance did a phoenix have against the king of serpents?  Something huge hit the stone floor of the Chamber. Harry felt it shudder - he knew what was happening, he could sense it, could almost see the giant serpent uncoiling itself from Slytherin's mouth. Then he heard Riddle's hissing voice:  \\\\\\\"Kill him. \\\\\\\"  The basilisk was moving toward Harry; he could hear its heavy body slithering heavily across the dusty floor. Eyes still tightly shut, Harry began to run blindly sideways, his hands outstretched, feeling his way - Voldemort was laughing  Harry tripped. He fell hard onto the stone and tasted blood the serpent was barely feet from him, he could hear it coming  There was a loud, explosive spitting sound right above him, and then something heavy hit Harry so hard that he was smashed into the wall. Waiting for fangs to sink through his body he heard more mad hissing, something thrashing wildly off the pillars  He couldn't help it - he opened his eyes wide enough to squint at what was going on.  The enormous serpent, bright, poisonous green, thick as an oak trunk, had raised itself high in the air and its great blunt head was weaving drunkenly between the pillars. As Harry trembled, ready to close his eyes if it turned, he saw what had distracted the snake.  Fawkes was soaring around its head, and the basilisk was snapping furiously at him with fangs long and thin as sabers  Fawkes dived. His long golden beak sank out of sight and a\\u00a0sudden shower of dark blood spattered the floor. The snake's tail thrashed, narrowly missing Harry, and before Harry could shut his eyes, it turned - Harry looked straight into its face and saw that its eyes, both its great, bulbous yellow eyes, had been punctured by the phoenix; blood was streaming to the floor, and the snake was spitting in agony.  \\\\\\\"NO!\\\\\\\" Harry heard Riddle screaming. \\\\\\\"LEAVE THE BIRD! LEAVE THE BIRD! THE BOY IS BEHIND YOU. YOU CAN STILL SMELL HIM. KILL HIMI\\\\\\\"  The blinded serpent swayed, confused, still deadly. Fawkes was circling its head, piping his eerie song, jabbing here and there at its scaly nose as the blood poured from its ruined eyes.  \\\\\\\"Help me, help me,\\\\\\\" Harry muttered wildly, \\\\\\\"someone - anyone  The snake's tail whipped across the floor again. Harry ducked. Something soft hit his face.  The basilisk had swept the Sorting Hat into Harry's arms. Harry seized it. It was all he had left, his only chance - he rammed it onto his head and threw himself flat onto the floor as the basilisk's tail swung over him again.  Help me - help me - Harry thought, his eyes screwed tight under the hat. Please help me  There was no answering voice. Instead, the hat contracted, as though an invisible hand was squeezing it very tightly.  Something very hard and heavy thudded onto the top of Harry's head, almost knocking him out. Stars winking in front of his eyes, he grabbed the top of the hat to pull it off and felt something long and hard beneath it.  A gleaming silver sword had appeared inside the hat, its handle glittering with rubies the size of eggs.  \\\\\\\"KILL THE BOY! LEAVE THE BIRD! THE BOY IS BEHIND YOU. SNIFF -- SMELL HIM.\\\\\\\"  Harry was on his feet, ready. The basilisk's head was falling, its body coiling around, hitting pillars as it twisted to face him. He could see the vast, bloody eye sockets, see the mouth stretching wide, wide enough to swallow him whole, lined with fangs long as his sword, thin, glittering, venomous -  It lunged blindly -- Harry dodged and it hit the Chamber wall. It lunged again, and its forked tongue lashed Harry's side. He raised the sword in both his hands -  The basilisk lunged again, and this time its aim was true -- Harry threw his whole weight behind the sword and drove it to the hilt into the roof of the serpent's mouth -  But as warm blood drenched Harry's arms, he felt a searing pain just above his elbow. One long, poisonous fang was sinking deeper and deeper into his arm and it splintered as the basilisk keeled over sideways and fell, twitching, to the floor.  Harry slid down the wall. He gripped the fang that was spreading poison through his body and wrenched it out of his arm. But he knew it was too late. White-hot pain was spreading slowly and steadily from the wound. Even as he dropped the fang and watched his own blood soaking his robes, his vision went foggy. The Chamber was dissolving in a whirl of dull color.  A patch of scarlet swam past, and Harry heard a soft clatter of claws beside him.  \\\\\\\"Fawkes,\\\\\\\" said Harry thickly. \\\\\\\"You were fantastic, Fawkes . . . .\\\\\\\"  1,520  He felt the bird lay its beautiful head on the spot where the serpent's fang had pierced him.  He could hear echoing footsteps and then a dark shadow moved in front of him.  \\\\\\\"You're dead, Harry Potter,\\\\\\\" said Riddle's voice above him. \\\\\\\"Dead. Even Dumbledore's bird knows it. Do you see what he's doing, Potter? He's crying.\\\\\\\"  Harry blinked. Fawke's head slid in and out of focus. Thick, pearly tears were trickling down the glossy feathers.  \\\\\\\"I'm going to sit here and watch you die, Harry Potter. Take your time. I'm in no hurry.\\\\\\\"  Harry felt drowsy. Everything around him seemed to be spinning.  \\\\\\\"So ends the famous Harry Potter,\\\\\\\" said Riddle's distant voice. \\\\\\\"Alone in the Chamber of Secrets, forsaken by his friends, defeated at last by the Dark Lord he so unwisely challenged. You'll be back with your dear Mudblood mother soon, Harry... She bought you twelve years of borrowed time ... but Lord Voldemort got you in the end, as you knew he must . . . .\\\\\\\"  If this is dying, thought Harry, it's not so bad.  Even the pain was leaving him ....  But was this dying? Instead of going black, the Chamber seemed to be coming back into focus. Harry gave his head a little shake and there was Fawkes, still resting his head on Harry's arm. A pearly patch of tears was shining all around the wound -- except that there was no wound  \\\\\\\"Get away, bird,\\\\\\\" said Riddle's voice suddenly. \\\\\\\"Get away from him - I said, get away --\\\\\\\"  Harry raised his head. Riddle was pointing Harry's wand at  Fawkes; there was a bang like a gun, and Fawkes took flight again in a whirl of gold and scarlet.  \\\\\\\"Phoenix tears. - .\\\\\\\" said Riddle quietly, staring at Harry's arm. \\\\\\\"Of course ... healing powers ... I forgot. . .\\\\\\\"  He looked into Harry's face. \\\\\\\"But it makes no difference. In fact, I prefer it this way. Just you and me, Harry Potter ... you and me....  He raised the wand  Then, in a rush of wings, Fawkes had soared back overhead and something fell into Harry's lap -- the diary.  For a split second, both Harry and Riddle, wand still raised, stared at it. Then, without thinking, without considering, as though he had meant to do it all along, Harry seized the basilisk fang on the floor next to him and plunged it straight into the heart of the book.  There was a long, dreadful, piercing scream. Ink spurted out of the diary in torrents, streaming over Harry's hands, flooding the floor. Riddle was writhing and twisting, screaming and flailing and then  He had gone. Harry's wand fell to the floor with a clatter and there was silence. Silence except for the steady drip drip of ink still oozing from the diary. The basilisk venom had burned a sizzling hole right through it.  Shaking all over, Harry pulled himself up. His head was spinning as though he'd just traveled miles by Floo powder. Slowly, he gathered together his wand and the Sorting Hat, and, with a huge tug, retrieved the glittering sword from the roof of the basilisk's mouth.  Then came a faint moan from the end of the Chamber. Ginny was stirring. As Harry hurried toward her, she sat up. Her bemused\\u00a0eyes traveled from the huge form of the dead basilisk, over Harry, in his blood-soaked robes, then to the diary in his hand. She drew a great, shuddering gasp and tears began to pour down her face.  \\\\\\\"Harry -- oh, Harry -- I tried to tell you at b-breakfast, but I c-couldn't say it in front of Percy -- it was me, Harry -- but I -- I s-swear I d- diddt mean to -- R-Riddle made me, he t-took me over -- and - how did you kill that -- that thing? W-where's Riddle? The last thing I r- remember is him coming out of the diary --\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\" It's all right,\\\\\\\" said Harry, holding up the diary, and showing Ginny the fang hole, \\\\\\\"Riddle's finished. Look! Him and the basilisk. C'mon, Ginny, let's get out of here --\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"I'm going to be expelled!\\\\\\\" Ginny wept as Harry helped her awkwardly to her feet. \\\\\\\"I've looked forward to coming to Hogwarts ever since B-Bill came and n-now I'll have to leave and -- w-what'll Mum and Dad say?\\\\\\\"  Fawkes was waiting for them, hovering in the Chamber entrance. Harry urged Ginny forward; they stepped over the motionless coils of the dead basilisk, through the echoing gloom, and back into the tunnel. Harry heard the stone doors close behind them with a soft hiss.  After a few minutes' progress up the dark tunnel, a distant sound of slowly shifting rock reached Harry's ears.  \\\\\\\"Ron!\\\\\\\" Harry yelled, speeding up. \\\\\\\"Ginny's okay! I've got her!\\\\\\\"  He heard Ron give a strangled cheer, and they turned the next bend to see his eager face staring through the sizable gap he had managed to make in the rock fall.  \\\\\\\"Ginny!\\\\\\\" Ron thrust an arm through the gap in the rock to pull\\u00a0her through first. \\\\\\\"You're alive! I don't believe it! What happened?\\\\\\\" How - what -- where did that bird come from?\\\\\\\"  Fawkes had swooped through the gap after Ginny.  \\\\\\\"He's Dumbledore's,\\\\\\\" said Harry, squeezing through himself  \\\\\\\"How come you've got a sword?\\\\\\\" said Ron, gaping at the glittering weapon in Harry's hand.  \\\\\\\"I'll explain when we get out of here,\\\\\\\" said Harry with a sideways glance at Ginny, who was crying harder than ever.  \\\\\\\"But --\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"Later,\\\\\\\" Harry said shortly. He didn't think it was a good idea to tell Ron yet who'd been opening the Chamber, not in front of Ginny, anyway. \\\\\\\"Where's Lockhart?\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"Back there,\\\\\\\" said Ron, still looking puzzled but jerking his head up the tunnel toward the pipe. \\\\\\\"He's in a bad way. Come and see.\\\\\\\"  Led by Fawkes, whose wide scarlet wings emitted a soft golden glow in the darkness, they walked all the way back to the mouth of the pipe. Gilderoy Lockhart was sitting there, humming placidly to himself.  \\\\\\\"His memory's gone,\\\\\\\" said Ron. \\\\\\\"The Memory Charm backfired. Hit him instead of us. Hasn't got a clue who he is, or where he is, or who we are. I told him to come and wait here. He's a danger to himself\\\\\\\"  Lockhart peered good-naturedly up at them all.  \\\\\\\"Hello,\\\\\\\" he said. \\\\\\\"Odd sort of place, this, isn't it? Do you live here?\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"No,\\\\\\\" said Ron, raising his eyebrows at Harry.  Harry bent down and looked up the long, dark pipe.  \\\\\\\"Have you thought how we're going to get back up this?\\\\\\\" he said to Ron.\\u00a0  Ron shook his head, but Fawkes the phoenix had swooped past Harry and was now fluttering in front of him, his beady eyes bright in the dark. He was waving his long golden tail feathers. Harry looked uncertainly at him.  \\\\\\\"He looks like he wants you to grab hold. . .\\\\\\\" said Ron, looking perplexed. \\\\\\\"But you're much too heavy for a bird to pull up there -\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"Fawkes,\\\\\\\" said Harry, \\\\\\\"isn't an ordinary bird.\\\\\\\" He turned quickly to the others. \\\\\\\"We've got to hold on to each other. Ginny, grab Ron's hand. Professor Lockhart --\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"He means you,\\\\\\\" said Ron sharply to Lockhart.  \\\\\\\"You hold Ginny's other hand --\\\\\\\"  Harry tucked the sword and the Sorting Hat into his belt, Ron took hold of the back of Harry's robes, and Harry reached out and took hold of Fawkes's strangely hot tail feathers.  An extraordinary lightness seemed to spread through his whole body and the next second, in a rush of wings, they were flying upward through the pipe. Harry could hear Lockhart dangling below him, saying, \\\\\\\"Amazing! Amazing! This is just like magic!\\\\\\\" The chill air was whipping through Harry's hair, and before he'd stopped enjoying the ride, it was over -- all four of them were hitting the wet floor of Moaning Myrtle's bathroom, and as Lockhart straightened his hat, the sink that hid the pipe was sliding back into place.  Myrtle goggled at them.  \\\\\\\"You're alive,\\\\\\\" she said blankly to Harry.  \\\\\\\"There's no need to sound so disappointed,\\\\\\\" he said grimly, wiping flecks of blood and slime off his glasses.\\u00a0  \\\\\\\"Oh, well ... Id just been thinking ... if you had died, you'd have been welcome to share my toilet,\\\\\\\" said Myrtle, blushing silver.  \\\\\\\"Urgh!\\\\\\\" said Ron as they left the bathroom for the dark, deserted corridor outside. \\\\\\\"Harry! I think Myrtle's grown fond of you! You've got competition, Ginny!\\\\\\\"  But tears were still flooding silently down Ginny's face.  \\\\\\\"Where now?\\\\\\\" said Ron, with an anxious look at Ginny. Harry pointed.  Fawkes was leading the way, glowing gold along the corridor. They strode after him, and moments later, found themselves outside Professor McGonagall's office.  Harry knocked and pushed the door open.  G F-I A P T E IR  k' I G 14 T V V N  DO  Y'$ REWARD  or a moment there was silence as Harry, Ron, Ginny, and Lockhart stood in the doorway, covered in muck and slime and (in Harry's case) blood. Then there was a scream.  \\\\\\\"Ginny!\\\\\\\"  It was Mrs. Weasley, who had been sitting crying in front of the fire. She leapt to her feet, closely followed by Mr. Weasley, and both of them flung themselves on their daughter.  Harry, however, was looking past them. Professor Dumbledore was standing by the mantelpiece, beaming, next to Professor McGonagall, who was taking great, steadying gasps, clutching her chest. Fawkes went whooshing past Harry's ear and settled on Dumbledore's shoulder, just as Harry found himself and Ron being swept into Mrs. Weasleys tight embrace.  \\\\\\\"You saved her! You saved her! How did you do it?\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"I think we'd all like to know that,\\\\\\\" said Professor McGonagall weakly.  Mrs. Weasley let go of Harry, who hesitated for a moment, then walked over to the desk and laid upon it the Sorting Hat, the rubyencrusted sword, and what remained of Riddle's diary.  Then he started telling them everything. For nearly a quarter of an hour he spoke into the rapt silence: He told them about hearing the disembodied voice, how Hermione had finally realized that he was hearing a basilisk in the pipes; how he and Ron had followed the spiders into the forest, that Aragog had told them where the last victim of the basilisk had died; how he had guessed that Moaning Myrtle had been the victim, and that the entrance to the Chamber of Secrets might be in her bathroom ....  \\\\\\\"Very well,\\\\\\\" Professor McGonagall prompted him as he paused, \\\\\\\"so you found out where the entrance was -- breaking a hundred school rules into pieces along the way, I might add - but how on earth did you all get out of there alive, Potter?\\\\\\\"  So Harry, his voice now growing hoarse from all this talking, told them about Fawkes's timely arrival and about the Sorting Hat giving him the sword. But then he faltered. He had so far avoided mentioning Riddle's diary -- or Ginny. She was standing with her head against Mrs. Weasley's shoulder, and tears were still coursing silently down her cheeks. What if they expelled her? Harry thought in panic. Riddle's diary didn't work anymore .... How could they prove it had been he who'd made her do it all?  Instinctively, Harry looked at Dumbledore, who smiled faintly, the firelight glancing off his half-moon spectacles.  \\\\\\\"\\\\What interests me most,\\\\\\\" said Dumbledore gently, \\\\\\\"is how Lord Voldemort managed to enchant Ginny, when my sources tell me he is currently in hiding in the forests of Albania.\\\\\\\"\\u00a0  Relief -- warm, sweeping, glorious relief -- swept over Harry. \\\\\\\"W- what's that?\\\\\\\" said Mr. Weasley in a stunned voice. \\\\\\\"YouKnow-Who? En-enchant Ginny? But Ginny's not ... Ginny hasn't been ... has she?\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"It was this diary,\\\\\\\" said Harry quickly, picking it up and showing it to Dumbledore. \\\\\\\"Riddle wrote it when he was sixteen . . . .\\\\\\\"  Dumbledore took the diary from Harry and peered keenly down his long, crooked nose at its burnt and soggy pages.  \\\\\\\"Brilliant,\\\\\\\" he said softly. \\\\\\\"Of course, he was probably the most brilliant student Hogwarts has ever seen.\\\\\\\" He turned around to the Weasleys, who were looking utterly bewildered.  \\\\\\\"Very few people know that Lord Voldemort was once called Tom Riddle. I taught him myself, fifty years ago, at Hogwarts. He disappeared after leaving the school ... traveled far and wide ... sank so deeply into the Dark Arts, consorted with the very worst of our kind, underwent so many dangerous, magical transformations, that when he resurfaced as Lord Voldemort, he was barely recognizable. Hardly anyone connected Lord Voldemort with the clever, handsome boy who was once Head Boy here.\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"But, Ginny,\\\\\\\" said Mrs. Weasley. \\\\\\\"What's our Ginny got to do with - with -- him?\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"His d-diaryl\\\\\\\" Ginny sobbed. \\\\\\\"I've b-been writing in it, and he's been w-writing back all year --\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"tinny!\\\\\\\" said Mr. Weasley, flabbergasted. \\\\\\\"Haven't I taught you anything. What have I always told you? Never trust anything that can think for itself if you can't see where it keeps its brain? Why didn't you show the diary to me, or your mother? A suspicious object like that, it was clearly full of Dark Magic ='\\u00a0  \\\\\\\"I d-didn't know,\\\\\\\" sobbed Ginny. \\\\\\\"I found it inside one of the books Mum got me. I th-thought someone had just left it in there and forgotten about it --\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"Miss Weasley should go up to the hospital wing right away,\\\\\\\" Dumbledore interrupted in a firm voice. \\\\\\\"This has been a terrible ordeal for her. There will be no punishment. Older and wiser wizards than she have been hoodwinked by Lord Voldemort.\\\\\\\" He strode over to the door and opened it. \\\\\\\"Bed rest and perhaps a large, steaming mug of hot chocolate. I always find that cheers me up,\\\\\\\" he added, twinkling kindly down at her. \\\\\\\"You will find that Madam Pomfrey is still awake. She's just giving out Mandrake juice -- I daresay the basilisk's victims will be waking up any moment.\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"So Hermione's okay!\\\\\\\" said Ron brightly.  \\\\\\\"There has been no lasting harm done, Ginny,\\\\\\\" said Dumbledore.  Mrs. Weasley led Ginny out, and Mr. Weasley followed, still looking deeply shaken.  \\\\\\\"You know, Minerva,\\\\\\\" Professor Dumbledore said thoughtfully to Professor McGonagall, \\\\\\\"I think all this merits a good feast. Might I ask you to go and alert the kitchens?\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"Right,\\\\\\\" said Professor McGonagall crisply, also moving to the door. \\\\\\\"I'll leave you to deal with Potter and Weasley, shall I?\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"Certainly,\\\\\\\" said Dumbledore.  She left, and Harry and Ron gazed uncertainly at Dumbledore. What exactly had Professor McGonagall meant, deal with them? Surely - surely - they weren't about to be punished?  \\\\\\\"I seem to remember telling you both that I would have to expel you if you broke any more school rules, said Dumbledore.\\u00a0  Ron opened his mouth in horror.  \\\\\\\"Which goes to show that the best of us must sometimes eat our words,\\\\\\\" Dumbledore went on, smiling. \\\\\\\"You will both receive Special Awards for Services to the School and -- let me see - yes, I think two hundred points apiece for Gryffindor.\\\\\\\"  Ron went as briglitly pink as Lockhart's valentine flowers and closed his mouth again.  \\\\\\\"But one of us seems to be keeping mightily quiet about his part in this dangerous adventure,\\\\\\\" Dumbledore added. \\\\\\\"Why so modest, Gilderoy?\\\\\\\"  Harry gave a start. He had completely forgotten about Lockhart. He turned and saw that Lockhart was standing in a corner of the room, still wearing his vague smile. When Dumbledore addressed him, Lockhart looked over his shoulder to see who he was talking to.  \\\\\\\"Professor Dumbledore,\\\\\\\" Ron said quickly, \\\\\\\"there was an accident down in the Chamber of Secrets. Professor Lockhart --\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"Am I a professor?\\\\\\\" said Lockhart in mild surprise. \\\\\\\"Goodness. I expect I was hopeless, was I?\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"He tried to do a Memory Charm and the wand backfired,\\\\\\\" Ron explained quietly to Dumbledore.  \\\\\\\"Dear me,\\\\\\\" said Dumbledore, shaking his head, his long silver mustache quivering. \\\\\\\"Impaled upon your own sword, Gilderoy!\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"Sword?\\\\\\\" said Lockhart dimly. \\\\\\\"Haven't got a sword. That boy has, though.\\\\\\\" He pointed at Harry. \\\\\\\"He'll lend you one.\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"Would you mind taking Professor Lockhart up to the infirmary, too?\\\\\\\" Dumbledore said to Ron. \\\\\\\"Id like a few more words with Harry .....  Lockhart ambled out. Ron cast a curious look back at Dumbledore and Harry as he closed the door.  Dumbledore crossed to one of the chairs by the fire.  \\\\\\\"Sit down, Harry,\\\\\\\" he said, and Harry sat, feeling unaccountably nervous.  \\\\\\\"First of all, Harry, I want to thank you,\\\\\\\" said Dumbledore, eyes twinkling again. \\\\\\\"You must have shown me real loyalty down in the Chamber. Nothing but that could have called Fawkes to you.\\\\\\\"  He stroked the phoenix, which had fluttered down onto his knee. Harry grinned awkwardly as Dumbledore watched him.  \\\\\\\"And so you met Tom Riddle,\\\\\\\" said Dumbledore thoughtfully. \\\\\\\"I imagine he was most interested in you . . . . \\\\\\\"  Suddenly, something that was nagging at Harry came tumbling out of his mouth.  \\\\\\\"Professor Dumbledore ... Riddle said I'm like him. Strange likenesses, he said ......  \\\\\\\"Did he, now?\\\\\\\" said Dumbledore, looking thoughtfully at Harry from under his thick silver eyebrows. \\\\\\\"And what do you think, Harry?\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"I don't think I'm like him!\\\\\\\" said Harry, more loudly than he'd intended. \\\\\\\"I mean, I'm -- I'm in Gryffindor, I'm . . .\\\\\\\"  But he fell silent, a lurking doubt resurfacing in his mind.  \\\\\\\"Professor,\\\\\\\" he started again after a moment. \\\\\\\"The Sorting Hat told me Id -- Id have done well in Slytherin. Everyone thought I was Slytherin's heir for a while ... because I can speak Parseltongue ....  \\\\\\\"You can speak Parseltongue, Harry,\\\\\\\" said Dumbledore calmly, \\\\\\\"because Lord Voldemort -- who is the last remaining ancestor\\u00a0of Salazar Slytherin -- can speak Parseltongue. Unless I'm much mistaken, he transferred some of his own powers to you the night he gave you that scar. Not something he intended to do, I'm sure ....  \\\\\\\"Voldemort put a bit of himself in me?\\\\\\\" Harry said, thunderstruck.  \\\\\\\"It certainly seems so.\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"So I should be in Slytherin,\\\\\\\" Harry said, looking desperately into Dumbledore's face. \\\\\\\"The Sorting Hat could see Slytherin's power in me, and it --\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"Put you in Gryffindor,\\\\\\\" said Dumbledore calmly. \\\\\\\"Listen to me, Harry. You happen to have many qualities Salazar Slytherin prized in his hand- picked students. His own very rare gift, Parseltongue - resourcefulness - determination -- a certain disregard for rules,\\\\\\\" he added, his mustache quivering again. \\\\\\\"Yet the Sorting Hat placed you in Gryffindor. You know why that was. Think.\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"It only put me in Gryffindor,\\\\\\\" said Harry in a defeated voice, \\\\\\\"because I asked not to go in Slytherin . . . .\\\\\\\"  `Exactly, \\\\\\\"said Dumbledore, beaming once more. \\\\\\\"Which makes you very different from Tom Riddle. It is our choices, Harry, that show what we truly are, far more than our abilities.\\\\\\\" Harry sat motionless in his chair, stunned. \\\\\\\"If you want proof, Harry, that you belong in Gryffindor, I suggest you look more closely at this.\\\\\\\"  Dumbledore reached across to Professor McGonagall's desk, picked up the blood-stained silver sword, and handed it to Harry. Dully, Harry turned it over, the rubies blazing in the firelight. And then he saw the name engraved just below the hilt.  Godric Gryffindor\\u00a0  \\\\\\\"Only a true Gryffindor could have pulled that out of the hat, Harry,\\\\\\\" said Dumbledore simply.  For a minute, neither of them spoke. Then Dumbledore pulled open one of the drawers in Professor McGonagall's desk and took out a quill and a bottle of ink.  What you need, Harry, is some food and sleep. I suggest you go down to the feast, while I write to Azkaban -- we need our gamekeeper back. And I must draft an advertisement for the Daily Prophet, too,\\\\\\\" he added thoughtfully. \\\\\\\"We'll be needing a new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher... Dear me, we do seem to run through them, don't we?\\\\\\\"  Harry got up and crossed to the door. He had just reached for the handle, however, when the door burst open so violently that it bounced back off the wall.  Lucius Malfoy stood there, fury in his face. And cowering behind his legs, heavily wrapped in bandages, was Dobby.  \\\\\\\"Good evening, Lucius,\\\\\\\" said Dumbledore pleasantly.  Mr. Malfoy almost knocked Harry over as he swept into the room. Dobby went scurrying in after him, crouching at the hem of his cloak, a look of abject terror on his face.  The elf was carrying a stained rag with which he was attempting to finish cleaning Mr. Malfoys shoes. Apparently Mr. Malfoy had set out in a great hurry, for not only were his shoes half-polished, but his usually sleek hair was disheveled. Ignoring the elf bobbing apologetically around his ankles, he fixed his cold eyes upon Dumbledore.  \\\\\\\"So!\\\\\\\" he said \\\\\\\"You've come back. The governors suspended you, but you still saw fit to return to Hogwarts.\\\\\\\"\\u00a0  \\\\\\\"Well, you see, Lucius,\\\\\\\" said Dumbledore, smiling serenely, \\\\\\\"the other eleven governors contacted me today. It was something like being caught in a hailstorm of owls, to tell the truth. They'd heard that Arthur Weasleys daughter had been killed and wanted me back here at once. They seemed to think I was the best man for the job after all. Very strange tales they told me, too .... Several of them seemed to think that you had threatened to curse their families if they didn't agree to suspend me in the first place.\\\\\\\"  Mr. Malfoy went even paler than usual, but his eyes were still slits of fury.  \\\\\\\"So -- have you stopped the attacks yet?\\\\\\\" he sneered. \\\\\\\"Have you caught the culprit?\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"We have,\\\\\\\" said Dumbledore, with a smile.  \\\\\\\"Well?\\\\\\\"said Mr. Malfoy sharply. \\\\\\\"Who is it?\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"The same person as last time, Lucius,\\\\\\\" said Dumbledore. \\\\\\\"But this time, Lord Voldemort was acting through somebody else. By means of this diary.\\\\\\\"  He held up the small black book with the large hole through the center, watching Mr. Malfoy closely. Harry, however, was watching Dobby.  The elf was doing something very odd. His great eyes fixed meaningfully on Harry, he kept pointing at the diary, then at Mr. Malfoy, and then hitting himself hard on the head with his fist.  \\\\\\\"I see. . . \\\\\\\" said Mr. Malfoy slowly to Dumbledore.  \\\\\\\"A clever plan,\\\\\\\" said Dumbledore in a level voice, still staring Mr. Malfoy straight in the eye. \\\\\\\"Because if Harry here\\\\\\\" --Mr. Malfoy shot Harry a swift, sharp look -- \\\\\\\"and his friend Ron hadn't discovered this book, why -- Ginny Weasley might have taken all\\u00a0the blame. No one would ever have been able to prove she hadn't acted of her own free will ......  Mr. Malfoy said nothing. His face was suddenly masklike.  \\\\\\\"And imagine,\\\\\\\" Dumbledore went on, \\\\\\\"what might have happened then .... The Weasleys are one of our most prominent pure-blood families. Imagine the effect on Arthur Weasley and his Muggle Protection Act, if his own daughter was discovered attacking and - killing Muggle-borns .... Very fortunate the diary was discovered, and Riddle's memories wiped from it. \\\\\\\"Who knows what the consequences might have been otherwise ......  Mr. Malfoy forced himself to speak.  \\\\\\\"Very fortunate,\\\\\\\" he said stiffly.  And still, behind his back, Dobby was pointing, first to the diary, then to Lucius Malfoy, then punching himself in the head.  And Harry suddenly understood. He nodded at Dobby, and Dobby backed into a corner, now twisting his ears in punishment.  \\\\\\\"Don't you want to know how Ginny got hold of that diary, Mr. Malfoy?\\\\\\\" said Harry.  Lucius Malfoy rounded on him.  \\\\\\\"How should I know how the stupid little girl got hold of it?\\\\\\\" he said.  \\\\\\\"Because you gave it to her,\\\\\\\" said Harry. \\\\\\\"In Flourish and Blotts. You picked up her old Transfiguration book and slipped the diary inside it, didn't you?\\\\\\\"  He saw Mr. Malfoy's white hands clench and unclench.  \\\\\\\"Prove it,\\\\\\\" he hissed.  \\\\\\\"Oh, no one will be able to do that,\\\\\\\" said Dumbledore, smiling at Harry. \\\\\\\"Not now that Riddle has vanished from the book. On\\u00a0the other hand, I would advise you, Lucius, not to go giving out any more of Lord Voldemort's old school things. If any more of them find their way into innocent hands, I think Arthur Weasley, for one, will make sure they are traced back to you ......  Lucius Malfoy stood for a moment, and Harry distinctly saw his right hand twitch as though he was longing to reach for his wand. Instead, he turned to his house-elf  \\\\\\\"We're going, Dobby!\\\\\\\"  He wrenched open the door and as the elf came hurrying up to him, he kicked him right through it. They could hear Dobby squealing with pain all the way along the corridor. Harry stood for a moment, thinking hard. Then it came to him -  \\\\\\\"Professor Dumbledore,\\\\\\\" he said hurriedly. \\\\\\\"Can I give that diary back to Mr. Malfoy, please?\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"Certainly, Harry,\\\\\\\" said Dumbledore calmly. \\\\\\\"But hurry. The feast, remember ......  Harry grabbed the diary and dashed out of the office. He could hear Dobby's squeals of pain receding around the corner. Quickly, wondering if this plan could possibly work, Harry took off one of his shoes, pulled off his slimy, filthy sock, and stuffed the diary into it. Then he ran down the dark corridor.  He caught up with them at the top of the stairs.  \\\\\\\"Mr. Malfoy,\\\\\\\" he gasped, skidding to a halt, \\\\\\\"I've got something for you --\\\\\\\"  And he forced the smelly sock into Lucius Malfoy's hand.  \\\\\\\")What the --?\\\\\\\"  Mr. Malfoy ripped the sock off the diary, threw it aside, then looked furiously from the ruined book to Harry.\\u00a0  You'll meet the same sticky end as your parents one of these days, Harry Potter,\\\\\\\" he said softly. \\\\\\\"They were meddlesome fools, too.  He turned to go.  \\\\\\\"Come, Dobby. I said, come.\\\\\\\"  But Dobby didn't move. He was holding up Harry's disgusting, slimy sock, and looking at it as though it were a priceless treasure.  \\\\\\\"Master has given a sock,\\\\\\\" said the elf in wonderment. \\\\\\\"Master gave it to Dobby.\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"What's that?\\\\\\\" spat Mr. Malfoy. \\\\\\\"What did you say?\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"Got a sock,\\\\\\\" said Dobby in disbelief. \\\\\\\"Master threw it, and Dobby caught it, and Dobby -- Dobby is free. \\\\\\\"  Lucius Malfoy stood frozen, staring at the elf Then he lunged at Harry.  \\\\\\\"You've lost me my servant, boy!\\\\\\\"  But Dobby shouted, \\\\\\\"You shall not harm Harry Potter!\\\\\\\"  There was a loud bang, and Mr. Malfoy was thrown backward. He crashed down the stairs, three at a time, landing in a crumpled heap on the landing below. He got up, his face livid, and pulled out his wand, but Dobby raised a long, threatening finger.  \\\\\\\"You shall go now,\\\\\\\" he said fiercely, pointing down at Mr. Malfoy. \\\\\\\"You shall not touch Harry Potter. You shall go now.\\\\\\\"  Lucius Malfoy had no choice. With a last, incensed stare at the pair of them, he swung his cloak around him and hurried out of sight.  \\\\\\\"Harry Potter freed Dobby!\\\\\\\" said the elf shrilly, gazing up at Harry, moonlight from the nearest window reflected in his orb-like eyes. \\\\\\\"Harry Potter set Dobby free!\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"Least I could do, Dobby,\\\\\\\" said Harry, grinning. \\\\\\\"Just promise never to try and save my life again.\\\\\\\"  The elf's ugly brown face split suddenly into a wide, toothy smile.  \\\\\\\"I've just got one question, Dobby,\\\\\\\" said Harry as Dobby pulled on Harry's sock with shaking hands. \\\\\\\"You told me all this had nothing to do with He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named, remember? Well --\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"It was a clue, sir,\\\\\\\" said Dobby, his eyes widening, as though this was obvious. \\\\\\\"Was giving you a clue. The Dark Lord, before he changed his name, could be freely named, you see?\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"Right,\\\\\\\" said Harry weakly. \\\\\\\"Well, Id better go. There's a feast, and my friend Hermione should be awake by now .....  Dobby threw his arms around Harry's middle and hugged him.  \\\\\\\"Harry Potter is greater by far than Dobby knew!\\\\\\\" he sobbed. \\\\\\\"Farewell, Harry Potter!\\\\\\\"  And with a final loud crack, Dobby disappeared.  Harry had been to several Hogwarts feasts, but never one quite like this. Everybody was in their pajamas, and the celebration lasted all night. Harry didn't know whether the best bit was Hermione running toward him, screaming \\\\\\\"You solved it! You solved it!\\\\\\\" or Justin hurrying over from the Hufflepuff table to wring. his hand and apologize endlessly for suspecting him, or Hagrid turning up at half past three, cuffing Harry and Ron so hard on the shoulders that they were knocked into their plates of trifle, or his and Ron's four hundred points for Gryffindor securing the House Cup for the second year running, or Professor McGonagall standing up to\\u00a0tell them all that the exams had been canceled as a school treat (\\\\\\\"Oh, no!\\\\\\\" said Hermione), or Dumbledore announcing that, unfortunately, Professor Lockhart would be unable to return next year, owing to the fact that he needed to go away and get his memory back. Quite a few of the teachers joined in the cheering that greeted this news.  \\\\\\\"Shame,\\\\\\\" said Ron, helping himself to a jam doughnut. \\\\\\\"He was starting to grow on me.\\\\\\\"  The rest of the final term passed in a haze of blazing sunshine. Hogwarts was back to normal with only a few, small differences - Defense Against the Dark Arts classes were canceled (\\\\\\\"but we've had plenty of practice at that anyway,\\\\\\\" Ron told a disgruntled Hermione) and Lucius Malfoy had been sacked as a school governor. Draco was no longer strutting around the school as though he owned the place. On the contrary, he looked resentful and sulky. On the other hand, Ginny Weasley was perfectly happy again.  Too soon, it was time for the journey home on the Hogwarts Express. Harry, Ron, Hermione, Fred, George, and Ginny got a compartment to themselves. They made the most of the last few hours in which they were allowed to do magic before the holidays. They played Exploding Snap, set off the very last of Fred and George's Filibuster fireworks, and practiced disarming each other by magic. Harry was getting very good at it.  They were almost at King's Cross when Harry remembered something.  \\\\\\\"Ginny - what did you see Percy doing, that he didn't want you to tell anyone?\\\\\\\"\\u00a0  \\\\\\\"Oh, that,\\\\\\\" said Ginny, giggling. \\\\\\\"Well - Percy's got a girlfriend.\\\\\\\" Fred dropped a stack of books on George's head.  \\\\\\\"What?\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"It's that Ravenclaw prefect, Penelope Clearwater,\\\\\\\" said Ginny. \\\\\\\"That's who he was writing to all last summer. He's been meeting her all over the school in secret. I walked in on them kissing in an empty classroom one day. He was so upset when she was -- you know - attacked. You won't tease him, will you?\\\\\\\" she added anxiously.  \\\\\\\"Wouldn't dream of it,\\\\\\\" said Fred, who was looking like his birthday had come early.  \\\\\\\"Definitely not,\\\\\\\" said George, sniggering.  The Hogwarts Express slowed and finally stopped.  Harry pulled out his quill and a bit of parchment and turned to Ron and Hermione.  \\\\\\\"This is called a telephone number,\\\\\\\" he told Ron, scribbling it twice, tearing the parchment in two, and handing it to them. \\\\\\\"I told your dad how to use a telephone last summer - he'll know. Call me at the Dursleys', okay? I can't stand another two months with only Dudley to talk to ......  \\\\\\\"Your aunt and uncle will be proud, though, won't they?\\\\\\\" said Hermione as they got off the train and joined the crowd thronging toward the enchanted barrier. \\\\\\\"When they hear what you did this year?\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"Proud?\\\\\\\" said Harry. \\\\\\\"Are you crazy? All those times I could've died, and I didn't manage it? They'll be furious ......  And together they walked back through the gateway to the Muggle world. '\\\"\",\n          \"\\u00a0The next day Harry confided in both Ron and Hermione the task that Dumbledore had set him, though separately, for Hermione still refused to remain in Ron's presence longer than it took to give him a contemptuous look.Ron thought that Harry was unlikely to have any trouble with Slughorn at all.'He loves you,' he said over breakfast, waving an airy forkful of fried egg. 'Won't refuse you anything, will he? Not his little Potions Prince. Just hang back after class this afternoon and ask him.'Hermione, however, took a gloomier view.'He must be determined to hide what really happened if Dumbledore couldn't get it out of him,' she said in a low voice, as they stood in the deserted, snowy courtyard at break. 'Horcruxes ... Horcruxes ... I've never even heard of them ...''You haven't?'Harry was disappointed; he had hoped that Hermione might have been able to give him a clue as to what Horcruxes were.'They must be really advanced Dark magic, or why would Voldemort have wanted to know about them? I think it's going to be difficult to get the information, Harry, you'll have to be very careful about how you approach Slughorn, think out a strategy ...\\\\'Ron reckons 1 should just hang back after Potions this afternoon ...''Oh, well, if Won-Won thinks that, you'd better do it,' she said, flaring up at once. 'After all, when has Won-Won's judgement ever been faulty?''Hermione, can't you \\u2014''No!' she said angrily, and stormed away, leaving Harry alone and ankle-deep in snow.Potions lessons were uncomfortable enough these days, seeing as Harry, Ron and Hermione had to share a desk. Today, Hermione moved her cauldron around the table so that she was close to Ernie, and ignored both Harry and Ron.'What've you done?' Ron muttered to Harry, looking at Hermione's haughty profile.But before Harry could answer, Slughorn was calling for silence from the front of the room.'Settle down, settle down, please! Quickly, now, lots of work to get through this afternoon! Golpalott's Third Law ... who can tell me -? But Miss Granger can, of course!'Hermione recited at top speed: 'Golpalott's-Third-Law- states-that-the-antidote-for-a-blended-poison-will-be-equal-to- more-than-the-sum-of-the-antidotes-for-each-of-the-separale- components.''Precisely!' beamed Slughorn. Ten points for Gryffindor! Now, if we accept Golpalott's Third Law as true ...\\\\\\\"Harry was going to have to take Slughorn's word for it that Golpalott's Third Law was true, because he had not under-stood any of it. Nobody apart from Hermione seemed to be following what Slughorn said next, either.'... which means, of course, that assuming we have achieved correct identification of the potion's ingredients by Scarpin's Revelaspell, our primary aim is not the relatively simple one of selecting antidotes to those ingredients in a\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0of themselves, but to find that added component which will, by an almost alchemical process, transform these disparate elements -'Ron was sitting beside Harry with his mouth half-open, doodling absently on his new copy of Advanced Potion-Making. Ron kept forgetting that he could no longer rely on Hermione to help him out of trouble when he failed to grasp what was going on.'... and so,' finished Slughorn, 'I want each of you to come and take one of these phials from my desk. You are to create an antidote for the poison within it before the end of the lesson. Good luck, and don't forget your protective gloves!'Hermione had left her stool and was halfway towards Siughorn's desk before the rest of the class had realised it was time to move, and by the time Harry, Ron and Ernie returned to the table, she had already tipped the contents of her phial into her cauldron and was kindling a fire underneath it.'it's a shame that the Prince won't be able to help you much with this, Harry,' she said brightly as she straightened up. 'You have to understand the principles involved this time. No short cuts or cheats!'Annoyed, Harry uncorked the poison he had taken from Siughorn's desk, which was a garish shade of pink, tipped it into his cauldron and lit a fire underneath it. He did not have the faintest idea what he was supposed to do next. He glanced at Ron, who was now standing there looking rather gormless, having copied everything Harry had done.'You sure the Prince hasn't got any tips?' Ron muttered to Harry.Harry pulled out his trusty copy of Advanced Potion-Making and turned to the chapter on Antidotes. There was Golpalott's Third Law, stated word for word as Hermione had recited it, but not a single illuminating note in the Prince's hand to explain what it meant. Apparently the Prince, like Hermione, had had no difficulty understanding it.'Nothing,' said Harry gloomily.Hermione was now waving her wand enthusiastically over her cauldron. Unfortunately, they could not copy the spell she was doing because she was now so good at non-verbal incan-tations that she did not need to say the words aloud. Ernie Macmillan, however, was muttering, 'Specialis revelio!' over his cauldron, which sounded impressive, so Harry and Ron hastened to imitate him.It took Harry only five minutes to realise that his reputa-tion as the best potion-maker in the class was crashing around his ears. Slughorn had peered hopefully into his cauldron on his first circuit of the dungeon, preparing to exclaim in delight as he usually did, and instead had with-drawn his head hastily, coughing, as the smell of bad eggs overwhelmed him. Hermione's expression could not have been any smugger; she had loathed being out-performed in every Potions class. She was now decanting the mysteriously separated ingredients of her poison into ten different crystal phials. More to avoid watching this irritating sight than any-thing else, Harry bent over the Half-Blood Prince's book and turned a few pages with unnecessary force.And there it was, scrawled right across a long list of antidotes.Just shove a bezoar down their throats.Harry stared at these words for a moment. Hadn't he once, long ago, heard of bezoars? Hadn't Snape mentioned them in their first ever Potions lesson? 'A stone taken from the stomach of a goat, which will protect from most poisons.'It was not an answer to the Golpalott problem, and had Snape still been their teacher, Harry would not have dared do it, but this was a moment for desperate measures. He hastened towards the store cupboard and rummaged within it, pushing aside unicorn horns and tangles of dried herbs until he found, at the very back, a small card box on which had been scribbled the word 'Bezoars'.He opened the box just as Slughorn called, Two minutes left, everyone!' Inside were half a dozen shrivelled brown objects, looking more like dried-up kidneys than real stones. Harry seized one, put the box back in the cupboard and hurried back to his cauldron.'Time's ... UP!' called Slughorn genially. 'Well, let's see how you've done! Blaise ... what have you got for me?'Slowly, Slughorn moved around the room, examining the various antidotes. Nobody had finished the task, although Hermione was trying to cram a few more ingredients into her bottle before Slughorn reached her. Ron had given up com-pletely, and was merely trying to avoid breathing in the putrid fumes issuing from his cauldron. Harry stood there waiting, the bezoar clutched in a slightly sweaty hand.Slughorn reached their table last. He sniffed Ernie's potion and passed on to Ron's with a grimace. He did not linger over Ron's cauldron, but backed away swiftly, retching slightly.'And you, Harry,' he said. 'What have you got to show me?'Harry held out his hand, the bezoar sitting on his palm.Slughorn looked down at it for a full ten seconds. Harry wondered, for a moment, whether he was going to shout at him. Then he threw back his head and roared with laughter.'You've got a nerve, boy!' he boomed, taking the bezoar and holding it up so that the class could see it. 'Oh, you're like your mother ... well, 1 can't fault you ... a bezoar would certainly act as an antidote to all these potions!'Hermione, who was sweaty-faced and had soot on her nose, looked livid. Her half-finished antidote, comprising fifty-two ingredients including a chunk of her own hair,bubbled sluggishly behind Slughorn, who had eyes for nobody but Harry.'And you thought of a bezoar all by yourself, did you, Harry?' she asked through gritted teeth.That's the individual spirit a real potion-maker needs!' said Slughorn happily, before Harry could reply. 'Just like his mother, she had the same intuitive grasp of potion-making, it's undoubtedly from Lily he gets it ... yes, Harry, yes, if you've got a bezoar to hand, of course that would do the trick ... although as they don't work on everything, and are pretty rare, it's still worth knowing how to mix antidotes ...'The only person in the room looking angrier than Hermione was Malfoy, who, Harry was pleased to see, had spilled some-thing that looked like cat sick over himself. Before either of them could express their fury that Harry had come top of the class by not doing any work, however, the bell rang.Time to pack up!' said Slughorn. 'And an extra ten points to Gryffindor for sheer cheek!'Still chuckling, he waddled back to his desk at the front of the dungeon.Harry dawdled behind, taking an inordinate amount of time to do up his bag. Neither Ron nor Hermione wished him luck as they left; both looked rather annoyed. At last Harry and Slughorn were the only two left in the room.'Come on, now, Harry, you'll be late for your next lesson,' said Slughorn affably, snapping the gold clasps shut on his dragonskin briefcase.'Sir,' said Harry, reminding himself irresistibly of Voldemort, '1 wanted to ask you something.''Ask away, then, my dear boy, ask away ...\\\\\\\"'Sir, 1 wondered what you know about ... about Horcruxes?'Slughorn froze. His round face seemed to sink in upon itself. He licked his lips and said hoarsely, 'What did you say?' 'I asked whether you know anything about Horcruxes, sir. You see -''Dumbledore put you up to this,' whispered Slughorn.His voice had changed completely. It was not genial any more, but shocked, terrified. He fumbled in his breast pocket and pulled out a handkerchief, mopping his sweating brow.'Dumbledore's shown you that - that memory,' said Slughorn. 'Well? Hasn't he?''Yes,' said Harry, deciding on the spot that it was best not to lie.'Yes, of course,' said Slughorn quietly, still dabbing at his white face. 'Of course ... well, if you've seen that memory, Harry, you'll know that I don't know anything - anything -he repeated the word forcefully '- about Horcruxes.'He seized his dragonskin briefcase, stuffed his handkerchief back into his pocket and marched to the dungeon door.'Sir,' said Harry desperately, 'I just thought there might be a bit more to the memory -''Did you?' said Slughorn. Then you were wrong, weren't you? WRONG!'He bellowed the last word and, before Harry could say another word, slammed the dungeon door behind him.Neither Ron nor Hermione was at all sympathetic when Harry told them of this disastrous interview Hermione was still seething at the way Harry had triumphed without doing the work properly. Ron was resentful that Harry hadn't slipped him a bezoar, too.'It would've just looked stupid if we'd both done it!' said Harry irritably. 'Look, I had to try and soften him up so I could ask him about Voldemort, didn't I? Oh, will you gel a grip!' he added in exasperation, as Ron winced at the sound of the name.Infuriated by his failure and by Ron and Hermione's atti-tudes, Harry brooded for the next few days over what to do next about Slughorn. He decided that, for the time being, he would let Slughorn think that he had forgotten all about Horcruxes; it was surely best to lull him into a false sense of security before returning to the attack.When Harry did noi question Slughorn again, the Potions master reverted to his usual affectionate treatment of him, and appeared to have put the matter from his mind. Harry awaited an invitation to one of his little evening parties, determined to accept this time, even if he had to reschedule Quidditch prac- tice. Unfortunately, however, no such invitation arrived. Harry checked with Hermione and Ginny: neither of them had received an invitation and nor, as far as they knew, had anybody else. Harry could not help wondering whether this meant that Slughorn was not quite as forgetful as he appeared, simply determined to give Harry no additional opportunities to question him.Meanwhile, the Hogwarts library had failed Hermione for the first lime in living memory. She was so shocked, she even forgot that she was annoyed at Harry for his trick with the bezoar,'I haven't found one single explanation of what Horcruxes do!\\\\\\\" she told him. 'Not a single one! I've been right through the restricted section and even in the most horrible books, where they tell you how to brew the most gruesome potions -nothing!

'Oh, shut up,' she snapped, stuffing it back into her bag. 'I asked whether you know anything about Horcruxes, sir. You see -\\u00a0'Dumbledore put you up to this,' whispered Slughorn,\\u00a0His voice had changed completely. It was not genial any more, but shocked, terrified.

I mean, why mention it, then?' she said impatiently, slamming the old book shut; it let out a ghostly wail. 'Oh, shut up,' she snapped, stuffing it back into her bag.\\u00a0The snow melted around the school as February arrived, to be replaced by cold, dreary wetness. Purplish-grey clouds hung low over the castle and a constant fall of chilly rain made the lawns slippery and muddy. The upshot of this was that the sixth-years' first Apparition lesson, which was sched-uled for a Saturday morning so that no normal lessons would be missed, took place in the Great Hall instead of in the grounds.\\u00a0When Harry and Hermione arrived in the Hall (Ron had come down with Lavender) they found that the tables had disappeared. Rain lashed against the high windows and the enchanted ceiling swirled darkly above them as they assembled in front of Professors McGonagall, Snape, Flitwick and Sprout - the Heads of House - and a small wizard whom Harry took to be the Apparition Instructor from the Ministry. He was oddly colourless, with transparent eyelashes, wispy hair and an insubstantial air, as though a single gust of wind might blow him away. Harry wondered whether constant dis-appearances and reappearances had somehow diminished his substance, or whether this frail build was ideal for anyone wishing to vanish.\\u00a0'Good morning,' said the Ministry wizard, when all the stu-dents had arrived and the Heads of House had called for quiet. 'My name is Wilkie Twycross and I shall be your Ministry-Apparition Instructor for the next twelve weeks. 1 hope to be able to prepare you for your Apparition test in this time -'\\u00a0'Malfoy, be quiet and pay attention!' barked Professor McGonagall.\\u00a0Everybody looked round. Malfoy had flushed a dull pink; he looked furious as he stepped away from Crabbe, with whom he appeared to have been having a whispered argu-ment. Harry glanced quickly at Snape, who also looked annoyed, though Harry strongly suspected that this was less because of Malfoy's rudeness than the fact that McGonagall had reprimanded one of his house.\\u00a0'- by which time, many of you may be ready to take your test,' Twycross continued, as though there had been no interruption.\\u00a0'As you may know, it is usually impossible to Apparate or Disapparate within Hogwarts. The Headmaster has lifted this enchantment, purely within the Great Hall, for one hour, so as to enable you to practise. May I emphasise that you will not be able to Apparate outside the walls of this Hall, and that you would be unwise to try.\\u00a0'I would like each of you to place yourselves now so that you have a clear five feet of space in front of you.'\\u00a0There was a great scrambiing and jostling as people separ-ated, banged into each other, and ordered others out of their space. The Heads of House moved among the students, marshalling them into position and breaking up arguments.\\u00a0'Harry, where are you going? 1 demanded Hermione.\\u00a0But Harry did not answer; he was moving quickly through the crowd, past the place where Professor Flitwick was making squeaky attempts to position a few Ravenclaws, all of whom wanted to be near the front, past Professor Sprout, who was chivvying the Hufflepuffs into line, until, by dodging around Ernie Macmillan, he managed to position himself right at the back of the crowd, directly behind Malfoy, who was taking advantage of the general upheaval to continue his argument with Crabbe, standing five feet away and looking mutinous.\\u00a0'I don't know how much longer, all right?' Malfoy shot at him, oblivious to Harry standing right behind him. 'It's taking longer than I thought it would.'\\u00a0Crabbe opened his mouth, but Malfoy appeared to second-guess what he was going to say.\\u00a0'Look, it's none of your business what I'm doing, Crabbe, you and Goyle just do as you're told and keep a lookout!'\\u00a0'! tell my friends what I'm up to, if I want them to keep a lookout for me,\\\\\\\" Harry said, just loud enough for Malfoy to hear him.\\u00a0Malfoy spun round on the spot, his hand flying to his wand, but at thai precise moment the four Heads of House shouted, 'Quiet!' and silence fell again. Malfoy turned slowly to face the front.\\u00a0Thank you,' said Twycross. :Now then ...'\\u00a0He waved his wand. Old-fashioned wooden hoops instantly appeared on the floor in from of every student.\\u00a0The important things to remember when Apparating are the three Ds!' said Twycross. 'Destination, Determination, Deliberation!\\u00a0'Step one: fix your mind firmly upon the desired destin-ation,' said Twycross. 'In this case, the interior of your hoop. Kindly concentrate upon that destination now.'\\u00a0Everybody looked around furtively, to check that everyone else was staring into their hoop, then hastily did as they were told. Harry gazed at the circular patch of dusty floor enclosed by his hoop and tried hard to think of nothing else. This proved impossible, as he couldn't stop puzzling over what Malfoy was doing that needed lookouts.\\u00a0\\\\\\\"Step two,' said Twycross, 'focus your determination to occupy the visualised space! Let your yearning to enter it flood from your mind to every particle of your body!'\\u00a0Harry glanced around surreptitiously. A little way to his left, Ernie Macmillan was contemplating his hoop so hard that his face had turned pink; it looked as though he was straining to lay a Quaffle-sized egg. Harry bit back a laugh and hastily returned his gaze to his own hoop.\\u00a0'Step three,' called Twycross, 'and only when 1 give the com-mand ... lum on the spot, feeiing your way into nothingness, moving with deliberation 1. On my command, now ... one- 1\\u00a0Harry glanced around again; lots of people were looking positively alarmed at being asked to Apparate so quickly.\\u00a0Harry tried to fix his thoughts on his hoop again; he had already forgotten what the three Ds stood for.\\u00a0: - THREE!'\\u00a0Harry spun on the spot, lost his balance and nearly fell over. He was not the only one. The whole Hall was suddenly full of staggering people; Neville was flat on his back; Ernie Macmillan, on the other hand, had done a kind of pirouet-ting leap into his hoop and looked momentarily thrilled, until he caught sight of Dean Thomas roaring with laughter at him.\\u00a0'Never mind, never mind,' said Twycross dryly, who did not seem to have expected anything better. 'Adjust your hoops, please, and back to your original positions ...'\\u00a0The second atlem.pt was no better than the first. The third was just as bad. Not until the fourth did anything exciting happen. There was a horrible screech of pain and everybody looked around, terrified, to see Susan Bones of Hufflepuff wobbling in her hoop with her left leg still standing five feet away where she had started.\\u00a0The Heads of House converged on her; there was a great bang and a puff of purple smoke, which cleared to reveal Susan sobbing, reunited with her leg but looking horrified.\\u00a0'Sph'nching, or the separation of random body parts,' said Wilkie Twycross dispassionately, 'occurs when the mind is insufficiently determined. You must concentrate continually upon your destination, and move, without hasie, but with deliberation ... thus.'Twycross stepped forwards, turned gracefully on the spot with his arms outstretched and vanished in a swirl of robes, reappearing at the back of the Hall. 'Remember the three Ds,' he said, 'and try again ... one -two - three -'\\u00a0But an hour later, Susan's Splinching was still ihe most interesting thing that had happened. Twycross did not seem discouraged. Fastening his cloak at his neck, he merely said, 'Until next Saturday, everybody, and do not forget: Destin-ation. Determination. Deliberation.'\\u00a0With that, he waved his wand, Vanishing the hoops, and walked out of the Hall accompanied by Professor McGonagall. Talk broke out at once as people began moving towards the Entrance Hall.\\u00a0'How did you do?' asked Ron, hurrying towards Harry. '1 think 1 felt something the last time I tried - a kind of tingling in my feet.'\\u00a0'1 expect your trainers are too small, Won-Won,' said a voice behind them, and Hermione stalked past, smirking.\\u00a0'1 didn't feel anything,' said Harry, ignoring this inter-ruption. \\\\\\\"But 1 don't care about that now-'\\u00a0'What d'you mean, you don't care ... don't you want to leam to Apparate?' said Ron incredulously.\\u00a0'I'm not fussed, really. I prefer flying,' said Harry, glancing over his shoulder to see where Malfoy was, and speeding up as they came into the Entrance Hall. 'Look, hurry up, will you, there's something I want to do ...'\\u00a0Perplexed, Ron followed Harry back to Gryffindor Tower at a run. They were temporarily detained by Peeves, who had jammed a door on the fourth floor shut and was refusing to let anyone pass until they set fire to their own pants, but Harry and Ron simply turned back and took one of their trusted short cuts. Within five minutes, they were climbing through the portrait hole.\\u00a0'Are you going to tell me what we're doing, then?' asked Ron, panting slightly.\\u00a0'Up here,' said Harry, and he crossed the common room and led the way through the door to the boys' staircase.\\u00a0Their dormitory was, as Ham' had hoped, empty. He flung open his trunk and began to rummage in it, while Ron watched impatiently.\\u00a0'Harry ...'\\u00a0'Malfoy's using Crabbe and Goyle as lookouts. He was argu-ing with Crabbe just now. 1 want to know ... aha.'\\u00a0He had found it, a folded square of apparently blank parchment, which he now smoothed out and tapped with [he tip of his wand.\\u00a0'I solemn!)' swear that I am up to no good ... or Malfoy is,\\u00a0At once, the Marauder's Map appeared on the parchment's surface. Here was a detailed plan of every one of the castle's floors and, moving around it, the tiny, labelled black dots that signified each of the castle's occupants.\\u00a0'Help me find Malfoy,' said Harry urgently.\\u00a0He laid the map upon his bed and he and Ron leaned over it, searching.\\u00a0'There!' said Ron, after a minute or so. 'He's in the Slytherin common room, look ... with Parkinson and Zabini and Crabbe and Goyle ...\\\\\\\"\\u00a0Harry looked down at the map, disappointed, but rallied almost at once.\\u00a0'Well, I'm keeping an eye on him from now on,' he said firmly. 'And the moment 1 see him lurking somewhere with Crabbe and Goyle keeping watch outside, it'll be on with the old Invisibility Cloak and off to find out what he's-'\\u00a0He broke off as Neville entered the dormitory, bringing with him a strong smell of singed material, and began rum-maging in his trunk for a fresh pair of pants.\\u00a0Despite his determination 10 catch Malfoy out, Harry had no luck at all over the next couple of weeks. Although he consulted the map as often as he could, sometimes making unnecessary visits to the bathroom between lessons to search it, he did not once see Malfoy anywhere suspicious. Admit-tedly, he spotted Crabbe and Goyle moving around the castle on their own more often than usual, sometimes remaining stationary in deserted corridors, but at these times Malfoy was not only nowhere near them, but impossible to locate on the map at all. This was most mysterious. Harry toyed with the possibility that Malfoy was actually leaving the school grounds, but could not see how he could be doing it, given the very high leve! of security now operating within the castle. He could only suppose ihat he was missing Malfoy amongst the hundreds of tiny black dots upon the map. As for the fact that Malfoy, Crabbe and Goyle appeared to be going their dif-ferent ways when they were usually inseparable, these things happened as people got older - Ron and Hermione, Harry reflected sadly, were living proof.\\u00a0February moved towards March with no change in the weather except that it became windy as well as wet. To general indignation, a sign went up on all common-room noticeboards that the next trip into Hogsmeade had been cancelled. Ron was furious.\\u00a0'It was on my birthday!' he said, 'i was looking forward to that!'\\u00a0'Not a big surprise, though, is it?' said Harry. 'Not after what happened to Katie.'\\u00a0She had still not returned from Si Mungo's. What was more, further disappearances had been reported in the Daily Prophet, including several relatives of students at Hogwarts.\\u00a0'But now all I've got to look forward to is stupid Appar-ition!' said Ron grumpily. 'Big birthday treat ...'\\u00a0Three lessons on, Apparition was proving as difficult as\\u00a0ever, though a few more people had managed to Splinch themselves. Frustration was running high and there was a certain amount of ill-feeling towards Wilkie Twycross and his three Ds, which had inspired a number of nicknames for him, the politest of which were Dog-breath and Dung-head.\\u00a0'Happy birthday, Ron,' said Harry, when they were woken on the first of March by Seamus and Dean leaving noisily for breakfast. 'Have a present.'\\u00a0He threw the package across on to Ron's bed, where it joined a small pile of them that must, Harry assumed, have been delivered by house-elves in the night.\\u00a0'Cheers,' said Ron drowsily, and as he ripped off the paper Harry got out of bed, opened his own crunk and began rum-maging in it for the Marauder's Map, which he hid after every use. He turfed out half the contents of his trunk before he found it hiding beneath the rolled-up socks in which he was still keeping his bottle of lucky potion, Felix Felicis.\\u00a0'Right,' he murmured, taking it back to bed with him, tap-ping it quietly and murmuring, 'I solemnly swear that I am up to no good,' so that Neville, who was passing the foot of his bed at the time, would not hear.\\u00a0'Nice one, Harry!' said Ron enthusiastically, waving the new pair of Quidditch Keeper's gloves Harry had given him.\\u00a0'No problem,' said Harry absent-mindedly, as he searched the Slytherin dormitory closely for Malfoy. 'Hey ... I don't think he's in his bed ...'\\u00a0Ron did not answer; he was too busy unwrapping presents, every now and then letting out an exclamation of pleasure.\\u00a0'Seriously good haul this year!' he announced, holding up a heavy gold watch with odd symbols around the edge and tiny moving stars instead of hands. 'See what Mum and Dad got me? Blimey, I think I'll come of age next year too ...\\u00a0'Cool,' muttered Harry, sparing the watch a glance before peering more closely at the map. Where was Malfoy? He did not seem to be at the Slytherin table in the Great Hall, eating breakfast ... he was nowhere near Snape, who was sitting in his study ... he wasn't in any of the bathrooms or in the hospital wing ...\\u00a0'Want one? 1 said Ron thickly, holding out a box of Chocolate Cauldrons.\\u00a0'No thanks,' said Harry, looking up. 'Malfoy's gone again!'\\u00a0'Can't have done,' said Ron, stuffing a second Cauldron into his mouth as he slid out of bed to get dressed. 'Come on. if you don't hurry up you'll have to Apparate on an empty-stomach ... might make it easier, 1 suppose ...\\\\\\\"\\u00a0Ron looked thoughtfully ai the box of Chocolate Cauldrons, then shrugged and helped himself to a third.\\u00a0Harry tapped the map with his wand, muttered, 'Mischief managed,' though it hadn't been, and got dressed, thinking hard. There had to be an explanation for Malfoy's periodic disappearances, but he simply could not think what it could be. The best way of finding out would be to tail him, bur even with the Invisibility Cloak this was an impractical idea; he had lessons, Quidditch practice, homework and Apparition; he could not follow Malfoy around school all day wilhout his absence being remarked upon,\\u00a0'Ready?' he said to Ron.\\u00a0He was halfway to the dormitory door when he realised that Ron had not moved, but was leaning on his bedpost, staring out of the rain-washed window with a strangely un-focused look on his face.\\u00a0'Ron? Breakfast.'\\u00a0'I'm not hungry,'\\u00a0Harry stared ai him.\\u00a0'I thought you just said -?'\\u00a0-Well, all right, I'll come down with you,' sighed Ron, 'but I don't want to eat.'\\u00a0Harry scrutinised him suspiciously.\\u00a0'You've just eaten half a box of Chocolate Cauldrons, haven't you?'\\u00a0'It's not that,' Ron sighed again. 'You ... you wouldn't understand.'\\u00a0'Fair enough,' said Harry, albeit puzzled, as he turned to open the door.\\u00a0'Harry!' said Ron suddenly.\\u00a0'What?'\\u00a0'Harry, I can't stand it!'\\u00a0'You can't stand what?' asked Harry, now starling to feel definitely alarmed. Ron was rather pale and looked as though he was about to be sick.\\u00a0'I can't stop thinking about her!' said Ron hoarsely.\\u00a0Harry gaped at him. He had not expected this and was not sure he wanted to hear it. Friends they might be, but if Ron started calling Lavender 'Lav-Lav', he would have to pui his foot down.\\u00a0'Why does that stop you having breakfast?' Harry asked, trying to inject a note of common sense into the proceedings.\\u00a0'I don't think she knows I exist,' said Ron with a desperate gesture.\\u00a0'She definitely knows you exist,' said Harry, bewildered. 'She keeps snogging you, doesn't she?'\\u00a0Ron blinked.\\u00a0'Who are you talking about?'\\u00a0Who are you talking about?' said Harry, with an increasing sense that all reason had dropped out of the conversation.\\u00a0'Romilda Vane,' said Ron softly, and his whole face seemed to illuminate as he said it, as though hit by a ray of purest sunlight. They stared at each other for almost a whole minute, before Harry said, 'This is a joke, right? You're joking.'\\u00a0T think ... Harry, 1 ihink I love her,' said Ron in a strangled voice.\\u00a0'OK,' said Harry, walking up to Ron 10 get a better look at the glazed eyes and the pallid complexion, 'OK ... say that again with a straight face.'\\u00a0'I love her,' repeated Ron breathlessly. 'Have you seen her hair, it's all black and shiny and silky ... and her eyes? Her big dark eyes? And her -'\\u00a0'This is really funny and everything,' said Harry impatiently, 'but joke's over, all right? Drop it.'\\u00a0He turned to leave; he had got two steps towards the door when a crashing blow hit him on the right ear. Staggering, he looked round. Ron's fist was drawn right back, his face was contorted with rage; he was about to strike again.\\u00a0Harry reacted instinctively; his wand was out of his pocket and the incantation sprang to mind without conscious thought: Le\\\\icorpus!Ron yelled as his heel was wrenched upwards once more; he dangled helplessly, upside-down, his robes hanging off him.\\u00a0'What was that for?' Harry bellowed.\\u00a0'You insulted her, Harry! You said it was a joke!' shouted Ron, who was slowly turning purple in the face as all the blood rushed to his head.\\u00a0'This is insane!' said Harry. 'What's got into -?'\\u00a0And then he saw the box lying open on Ron's bed and the truth hit him with the force of a stampeding troll.\\u00a0'Where did you get those Chocolate Cauldrons?'\\u00a0'They were a birthday present!' shouted Ron, revolving slowly in midair as he struggled to get free. '1 offered you one, didn't 1?'\\u00a0'You just picked them up off the floor, didn't you?'\\u00a0'They'd fallen off my bed, all right? Let me go!'\\u00a0'They didn't fall off your bed, you prat, don't you under-stand? They were mine, 1 chucked them out of my trunk when 1 was looking for the map. They're the Chocolate Cauldrons Romilda gave me before Christmas and they're all spiked with love potion!'\\u00a0But only one word of this seemed to have registered with Ron.\\u00a0'Romilda?' he repeated. 'Did you say Romilda? Harry - do you know her? Can you introduce me?'\\u00a0Harry stared at the dangling Ron, whose face now looked tremendously hopeful, and fought a strong desire to laugh. A part of him - the part closest to his throbbing right ear - was quite keen on the idea of letting Ron down and watching him run amok until the effects of the potion wore off ... but on the other hand, they were supposed to be friends, Ron had not been himself when he had attacked, and Harry- thought that he would deserve another punching if he permitted Ron to declare undying love for Romilda Vane.\\u00a0'Yeah, I'll introduce you,' said Harry, thinking fast. 'I'm going to let you down now, OK?'\\u00a0He sent Ron crashing back to the floor (his ear did hurt quite a lot), but Ron simply bounded to his feet again, grinning.\\u00a0'She'll be in Slughorn's office, 1 said Harry confidently, leading the way to the door.\\u00a0'Why will she be in there?' asked Ron anxiously, hurrying to keep up.\\u00a0'Oh, she has extra Potions lessons with him,' said Harry, inventing wildly.\\u00a0'Maybe 1 could ask if 1 can have them with her?' said Ron eagerly.\\u00a0'Great idea,' said Harry. Lavender was waiting beside the portrait hole, a complication Harry had not foreseen.\\u00a0'You're lace, Won-Won!' she pouted. 'I've got you a birth-day-'\\u00a0'Leave me alone,' said Ron impatiently, 'Harry's going to introduce me to Romilda Vane.'\\u00a0And without another word to her, he pushed his way oui of the portrait hole. Harry tried to make an apologetic face to Lavender, but it might have turned out simply amused, because she looked more offended than ever as the Fat Lady swung shut behind them.\\u00a0Harry had been slightly worried that Slughorn might be at breakfast, but he answered his office door at the first knock, wearing a green velvet dressing-gown and matching nightcap and looking rather bleary-eyed.\\u00a0'Harry,' he mumbled. 'This is very early for a call ... I generally sleep late on a Saturday ...\\\\\\\"\\u00a0'Professor, I'm really sorry to disturb you,' said Harry as quietly as possible, while Ron stood on tiptoe, attempting to see past Slughorn into his room, 'but my friend Ron's swallowed a love potion by mistake. You couldn't make him an antidote, could you? I'd take him to Madam Pomfrey, but we're not supposed to have anything from Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes and, you know ... awkward questions ...'\\u00a0Td have thought you could have whipped him up a remedy, Harry, an expert potioneer like you?' asked Slughorn. 'Er,' said Harry, somewhat distracted by the fact that Ron was now elbowing him in the ribs in an attempt to force his way into the room, 'well, I've never mixed an antidote for a love potion, sir, and by the time I get it right Ron might've done something serious -'\\u00a0Helpfully, Ron chose this moment to moan, 'I can't see her. Harry - is he hiding her?'\\u00a0'Was this potion within date?' asked Slughorn, now eyeing Ron with professional interest. 'They can strengthen, you know, the longer they're kept.'\\u00a0That would explain a lot,' panted Harry, now positively wrestling with Ron to keep him from knocking Slughorn over. 'It's his birthday, Professor,' he added imploringly.\\u00a0'Oh, all right, come in, then, come in,' said Slughorn, relenting. 'I've got the necessary here in my bag, it's not a difficult antidote ...'\\u00a0Ron burst through the door into Slughorn's overheated, crowded study, tripped over a tasselled footstool, regained his balance by seizing Harry around the neck and muttered, 'She didn't see that, did she?'\\u00a0'She's not here yet,' said Harry, watching Slughorn opening his potion kit and adding a few pinches of this and that to a small crystal bottle.\\u00a0That's good,' said Ron fervently. 'How do I look?'\\u00a0'Very handsome,' said Slughorn smoothly, handing Ron a glass of clear liquid. 'Now drink that up, it's a tonic for the nerves, keep you calm when she arrives, you know,'\\u00a0'Brilliant,' said Ron eagerly, and he gulped the antidote down noisily.\\u00a0Harry and Slughorn watched him. For a moment, Ron beamed at them. Then, very slowly, his grin sagged and van-ished, to be replaced by an expression of utmost horror.\\u00a0'Back to normal, then?' said Harry, grinning. Slughorn chuckled. Thanks a lot, Professor.'\\u00a0'Don't mention it, m'boy, don't mention it,' said Slughorn, as Ron collapsed into a nearby armchair, looking devastated. 'Pick-me-up, that's what he needs,' Slughorn continued, now-bustling over to a table loaded with drinks. 'I've got Butter-beer, I've got wine, I've got one last bottle of this oak-matured mead ... hmm ... meant to give that to Dumbledore for\\u00a0Christmas ... ah well ...' he shrugged '... he can't miss what he's never had! Why don't we open it now and celebrate Mr Weasley's birthday? Nothing like a fine spirit to chase away the pangs of disappointed love ...'\\u00a0He chortled again and Harry joined in. This was the firsi time he had found himself almost alone with Slughorn since his disastrous first attempt to extract the true memory from him. Perhaps, if he could just keep Slughorn in a good mood ... perhaps if they got through enough of the oak-matured mead ...\\u00a0There you are, then,' said Slughorn, handing Harry and Ron a glass of mead each, before raising his own. 'Well, a very happy birthday, Ralph -'\\u00a0'- Ron -' whispered Harry.\\u00a0But Ron, who did not appear to be listening to the toast, had already thrown the mead into his mouth and swallowed it.\\u00a0There was one second, hardly more than a heartbeat, in which Harry knew there was something terribly wrong and Slughorn, it seemed, did not.\\u00a0'- and may you have many more -\\u00a0'Ron!'Ron had dropped his glass; he half-rose from his chair and then crumpled, his extremities jerking uncontrollably. Foam was dribbling from his mouth and his eyes were bulging from their sockets.\\u00a0'Professor!' Harry bellowed. 'Do something]'\\u00a0But Slughorn seemed paralysed by shock. Ron twitched and choked: his skin was turning blue.\\u00a0'What - but -' spluttered Slughorn.\\u00a0Harry leapt over a low table and sprinted towards Slughorn's open potion kit, pulling out jars and pouches, while the terrible sound of Ron's gargling breath filled the room. Then\\u00a0he found it - the shrivelled kidney-like stone Slughorn had taken from him in Potions.\\u00a0He hurtled back to Ron's side, wrenched open his jaw and thrust the bezoar into his mouth. Ron gave a great shudder, a rattling gasp and his body became limp and still.\\\"\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Chapter\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 8,\n        \"min\": 5,\n        \"max\": 33,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 7,\n        \"samples\": [\n          5,\n          19,\n          18\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Book\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 2,\n        \"min\": 1,\n        \"max\": 7,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 7,\n        \"samples\": [\n          1,\n          2,\n          6\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Tokens\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"WordCount\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 889,\n        \"min\": 6817,\n        \"max\": 9295,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 7,\n        \"samples\": [\n          6817,\n          8831,\n          7380\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
